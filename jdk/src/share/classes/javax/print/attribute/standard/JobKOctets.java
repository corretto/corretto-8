/**
 * Class JobKOctets is an integer valued printing attribute class that specifies
 * the total size of the document(s) in K octets, i.e., in units of 1024 octets
 * requested to be processed in the job. The value must be rounded up, so that a
 * job between 1 and 1024 octets must be indicated as being 1K octets, 1025 to
 * 2048 must be 2K octets, etc. For a multidoc print job (a job with multiple
 * documents), the JobKOctets value is computed by adding up the individual
 * documents' sizes in octets, then rounding up to the next K octets value.
 * <P>
 * The JobKOctets attribute describes the size of the job. This attribute is not
 * intended to be a counter; it is intended to be useful routing and scheduling
 * information if known. The printer may try to compute the JobKOctets
 * attribute's value if it is not supplied in the Print Request. Even if the
 * client does supply a value for the JobKOctets attribute in the Print Request,
 * the printer may choose to change the value if the printer is able to compute
 * a value which is more accurate than the client supplied value. The printer
 * may be able to determine the correct value for the JobKOctets attribute
 * either right at job submission time or at any later point in time.
 * <P>
 * The JobKOctets value must not include the multiplicative factors contributed
 * by the number of copies specified by the {@link Copies Copies} attribute,
 * independent of whether the device can process multiple copies without making
 * multiple passes over the job or document data and independent of whether the
 * output is collated or not. Thus the value is independent of the
 * implementation and indicates the size of the document(s) measured in K octets
 * independent of the number of copies.
 * <P>
 * The JobKOctets value must also not include the multiplicative factor due to a
 * copies instruction embedded in the document data. If the document data
 * actually includes replications of the document data, this value will include
 * such replication. In other words, this value is always the size of the source
 * document data, rather than a measure of the hardcopy output to be produced.
 * <P>
 * The size of a doc is computed based on the print data representation class as
 * specified by the doc's {@link javax.print.DocFlavor DocFlavor}, as
 * shown in the table below.
 * <P>

 * data, replacing any JobKOctets value the client specified.
