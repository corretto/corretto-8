 * import com.sun.javadoc.* and implement the
 * <code>start(RootDoc)</code> method, as described in the
 * <a href="package-summary.html#package_description">package
 * description</a>.  If the doclet takes command line options,
 * it must also implement <code>optionLength</code> and
 * <code>validOptions</code>.
 *
 * <p> A doclet supporting the language features added since 1.1
 * (such as generics and annotations) should indicate this
 * by implementing <code>languageVersion</code>.  In the absence of
 * this the doclet should not invoke any of the Doclet API methods
 * added since 1.5, and
 * the results of several other methods are modified so as
 * to conceal the new constructs (such as type parameters) from
 * the doclet.
 *
 * <p> To start the doclet, pass
 * <code>-doclet</code> followed by the fully-qualified
 * name of the starting class on the javadoc tool command line.
