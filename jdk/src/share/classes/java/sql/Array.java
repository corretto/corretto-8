/**
 * The mapping in the Java programming language for the SQL type
 * <code>ARRAY</code>.
 * By default, an <code>Array</code> value is a transaction-duration
 * reference to an SQL <code>ARRAY</code> value.  By default, an <code>Array</code>
 * object is implemented using an SQL LOCATOR(array) internally, which
 * means that an <code>Array</code> object contains a logical pointer
 * to the data in the SQL <code>ARRAY</code> value rather
 * than containing the <code>ARRAY</code> value's data.
 * <p>
 * The <code>Array</code> interface provides methods for bringing an SQL
 * <code>ARRAY</code> value's data to the client as either an array or a
 * <code>ResultSet</code> object.
 * If the elements of the SQL <code>ARRAY</code>
 * are a UDT, they may be custom mapped.  To create a custom mapping,
 * a programmer must do two things:
 * <ul>
 * <li>create a class that implements the {@link SQLData}
 * interface for the UDT to be custom mapped.
 * <li>make an entry in a type map that contains
 *   <ul>
 *   <li>the fully-qualified SQL type name of the UDT
 *   <li>the <code>Class</code> object for the class implementing
 *       <code>SQLData</code>
 *   </ul>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * When a type map with an entry for
 * the base type is supplied to the methods <code>getArray</code>
 * and <code>getResultSet</code>, the mapping
 * it contains will be used to map the elements of the <code>ARRAY</code> value.
 * If no type map is supplied, which would typically be the case,
 * the connection's type map is used by default.
 * If the connection's type map or a type map supplied to a method has no entry
 * for the base type, the elements are mapped according to the standard mapping.
 * <p>
 * All methods on the <code>Array</code> interface must be fully implemented if the
 * JDBC driver supports the data type.
