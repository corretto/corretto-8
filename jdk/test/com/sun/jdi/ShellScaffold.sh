# jtreg runs this in a scratch dir.
# It (and runregress -no) sets these env vars:
#    TESTSRC:      The dir that contains this file
#    TESTCLASSES:  Where .class files are compiled to
#    TESTJAVA:     The jdk to run
#
# This is a 'library' script that is included by
# shell script test cases that want to run a .java file as the debuggee
# and use jdb as the debugger.  This file contains
# several functions that support such a test.

# The caller script can also set these shell vars before
# including this file:
#    pkg=<package name>       To use a package, define it here and put
#                                package $pkg
#                             in your java file
#    classname=<classnam>     Omit this to use the default class name, 'shtest'.

#    compileOptions=<string>  compile options for at least the first compile,
#                             eg, compileOptions=-g
#    compileOptions2=<string> Options for the 2nd, ..., compile. compileOptions1
#                             is used if this is not set.  To use no compile
#                             options for the 2nd ... compiles, do
#                             compileOptions2=none
#
#    mode=-Xcomp or mode=-Xint to run in these modes.  These should not
#                              really be used since the tests are normally
#                              run in both modes.
#    javacCmd=path-to-javac    to use a non-standard javac for compiling
#    compileOptions=<string>   Options to pass to javac
#
# See RedefineException.sh as an example of a caller script.
#
# To do RedefineClasses operations, embed @1 tags in the .java
# file to tell this script how to modify it to produce the 2nd
# version of the .class file to be used in the redefine operation.
# Here are examples of each editting tag and what change
# it causes in the new file.  Note that blanks are not preserved
# in these editing operations.
#
# @1 uncomment
#  orig:   // @1 uncomment   gus = 89;
#  new:         gus = 89;
#
# @1 commentout
#  orig:   gus = 89      // @1 commentout
#  new: // gus = 89      // @1 commentout
#
# @1 delete
#  orig:  gus = 89      // @1 delete
#  new:   entire line deleted
#
# @1 newline
#  orig:  gus = 89;     // @1 newline gus++;
#  new:   gus = 89;     //
#         gus++;
#
# @1 replace
#  orig:  gus = 89;     // @1 replace gus = 90;
#  new:   gus = 90;
#
# The only other tag supported is @1 breakpoint.  The setbkpts function
# sets bkpts at all lines that contain this string.
#
# Currently, all these tags are start with @1.  It is envisioned that this script
# could be ehanced to allow multiple cycles of redefines by allowing
# @2, @3, ... tags.  IE, processing the @i tags in the ith version of
# the file will produce the i+1th version of the file.
#
# There are problem with jtreg leaving behind orphan java and jdb processes
# when this script is run.  Sometimes, on some platforms, it just doesn't
# get them all killed properly.
# The solution is to put a magic word in the cmd lines of background java
# and jdb processes this script launches.  We can then do the right kind
# of ps cmds to find all these processes and kill them.  We do this by
# trapping the completion of this script.
#
# An associated problem is that our trap handler (cleanup) doesn't
# always get called when jtreg terminates a test.  This can leave tests
# hanging but following tests should run ok because each test uses
# unique names for the port and temp files (based on the PID returned
# by $$).
#
# mks 6.2a on win 98 presents two problems:
#   $! returns the PID as a negative number whereas ps returns
#      it in the form 0xFFF....  This means our trick of
#      of using $! to get the PIDs of the jdb and debuggee processes
#      doesn't work.  This will cause some error cases to fail
#      with a jtreg timeout instead of failing more gracefully.
#
#   There is no form of the ps command that will show the whole
#   cmd line.  Thus, the magic keyword trick doesn't work.  We
#   resort to just killing java.exe and jdb.exes
#
# pid usage:
#   debuggeepid: used in jdb process to detect if debuggee has died.
#                - waitForDebuggeeMsg: fail if debuggee is gone
#
#   jdbpid:   dofail: used to detect if in main process or jdb process
#             waitforfinish: quit if the jdb process is gone

    # jjh: We have a few intermittent failures here.
    # It is as if every so often, jdb doesn't
    # get the first cmd that is sent to it here.
    # (actually, I have seen it get the first cmd ok,
    # but then not get some subsequent cmd).
    # It seems like jdb really doesn't get the cmd; jdb's response
    # does not appear in the jxdboutput file. It contains:
    # main[1]
    # The application has been disconnected

    # Is it possible
    # that jdb got the cmd ok, but its response didn't make
    # it to the jxdboutput file?  If so, why did 'The application
    # has been disconnected' make it?

    # This causes the following loop to timeout and the test to fail.
    # The above echo works because the cmd (stop at ...)
    # is in the System.err shown in the .jtr file.
    # Also, the cmd is shown in the 'jdb never responded ...'
    # msg output below after the timeout.
    # And, we know jdb is started because the main[1] output is in the .jtr
    # file.  And, we wouldn't have gotten here if mydojdbcmds hadn't
    # seen the ].
    echo $*

    # Now we have to wait for the next jdb prompt.  We wait for a pattern
    # to appear in the last line of jdb output.  Normally, the prompt is
    #
    # 1) ^main[89] @
    #
    # where ^ means start of line, and @ means end of file with no end of line
    # and 89 is the current command counter. But we have complications e.g.,
    # the following jdb output can appear:
    #
    # 2) a[89] = 10
    #
    # The above form is an array assignment and not a prompt.
    #
    # 3) ^main[89] main[89] ...
    #
    # This occurs if the next cmd is one that causes no jdb output, e.g.,
    # 'trace methods'.
    #
    # 4) ^main[89] [main[89]] .... > @
    #
    # jdb prints a > as a prompt after something like a cont.
    # Thus, even though the above is the last 'line' in the file, it
    # isn't the next prompt we are waiting for after the cont completes.
    # HOWEVER, sometimes we see this for a cont command:
    #
    #   ^main[89] $
    #      <lines output for hitting a bkpt>
    #
    # 5) ^main[89] > @
    #
    # i.e., the > prompt comes out AFTER the prompt we we need to wait for.
    #
    # So, how do we know when the next prompt has appeared??
    # 1.  Search for
    #         main[89] $
    #     This will handle cases 1, 2, 3
    # 2.  This leaves cases 4 and 5.
    #
    # What if we wait for 4 more chars to appear and then search for
    #
    #    main[89] [>]$
    #
    # on the last line?
    #
    # a.  if we are currently at
    #
    #       ^main[89] main[89] @
    #
    #     and a 'trace methods comes in, we will wait until at least
    #
    #       ^main[89] main[89] main@
    #
    #     and then the search will find the new prompt when it completes.
    #
    # b.  if we are currently at
    #
    #       ^main[89] main[89] @
    #
    #     and the first form of cont comes in, then we will see
    #
    #       ^main[89] main[89] > $
    #       ^x@
    #
    #     where x is the first char of the msg output when the bkpt is hit
    #     and we will start our search, which will find the prompt
    #     when it comes out after the bkpt output, with or without the
    #     trailing >
