/**
 * This abstract policy assertion validator validates assertions by their qualified
 * name. Server and client side validation methods return {@link Fitness} based on
 * following schema:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link Fitness#SUPPORTED} - if the assertion qualified name is in the list of
 * supported assertion names on the server/client side</li>
 * <li>{@link Fitness#UNSUPPORTED} - if the assertion qualified name is not in the list of
 * supported assertion names on the server/client side, however it is in the list of
 * assertion names supported on the other side</li>
 * <li>{@link Fitness#UNKNOWN} - if the assertion qualified name is not present in the any of
 * the lists of supported assertion names</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * For some domains such validation may be sufficient enough. Other domains may
 * use functionality of this base class as a first step validation before any attempts
 * to validate content of the assertion. To do this one needs to override and reuse
 * the default behavior of {@link #validateClientSide(PolicyAssertion)} and
 * {@link #validateServerSide(PolicyAssertion)} methods.
