 * This class is designed for fans of POSIX pthreads programming.
 * If you restrict yourself to Mutexes and CondVars, you can

 * with synchronized methods or blocks though.
 * <p>
 * Method names and behavior are as close as is reasonable to
 * those in POSIX.
 * <p>
 * <b>Sample Usage.</b> Here is a full version of a bounded buffer
 * that implements the BoundedChannel interface, written in
 * a style reminscent of that in POSIX programming books.
