/**
 * The <code>DropTargetListener</code> interface
 * is the callback interface used by the
 * <code>DropTarget</code> class to provide
 * notification of DnD operations that involve
 * the subject <code>DropTarget</code>. Methods of
 * this interface may be implemented to provide
 * "drag under" visual feedback to the user throughout
 * the Drag and Drop operation.
 * <p>
 * Create a listener object by implementing the interface and then register it
 * with a <code>DropTarget</code>. When the drag enters, moves over, or exits
 * the operable part of the drop site for that <code>DropTarget</code>, when
 * the drop action changes, and when the drop occurs, the relevant method in
 * the listener object is invoked, and the <code>DropTargetEvent</code> is
 * passed to it.
 * <p>
 * The operable part of the drop site for the <code>DropTarget</code> is
 * the part of the associated <code>Component</code>'s geometry that is not
 * obscured by an overlapping top-level window or by another
 * <code>Component</code> higher in the Z-order that has an associated active
 * <code>DropTarget</code>.
 * <p>
 * During the drag, the data associated with the current drag operation can be
 * retrieved by calling <code>getTransferable()</code> on
 * <code>DropTargetDragEvent</code> instances passed to the listener's
 * methods.
 * <p>
 * Note that <code>getTransferable()</code> on the
 * <code>DropTargetDragEvent</code> instance should only be called within the
 * respective listener's method and all the necessary data should be retrieved
 * from the returned <code>Transferable</code> before that method returns.

     * the transfer of the data associated with the

     * shall accept or reject the drop via the
     * acceptDrop(int dropAction) or rejectDrop() methods of the
     * <code>DropTargetDropEvent</code> parameter.
     * <P>
     * Subsequent to acceptDrop(), but not before,
     * <code>DropTargetDropEvent</code>'s getTransferable()
     * method may be invoked, and data transfer may be
     * performed via the returned <code>Transferable</code>'s
     * getTransferData() method.
     * <P>
     * At the completion of a drop, an implementation
     * of this method is required to signal the success/failure
     * of the drop by passing an appropriate
     * <code>boolean</code> to the <code>DropTargetDropEvent</code>'s
     * dropComplete(boolean success) method.
     * <P>
     * Note: The data transfer should be completed before the call  to the
     * <code>DropTargetDropEvent</code>'s dropComplete(boolean success) method.
     * After that, a call to the getTransferData() method of the
     * <code>Transferable</code> returned by
     * <code>DropTargetDropEvent.getTransferable()</code> is guaranteed to
     * succeed only if the data transfer is local; that is, only if
     * <code>DropTargetDropEvent.isLocalTransfer()</code> returns
     * <code>true</code>. Otherwise, the behavior of the call is
     * implementation-dependent.
