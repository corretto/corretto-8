/**
 * Represents a SOAP message.
 *
 *
 * <h2>What is a message?</h2>
 * <p>
 * A {@link Message} consists of the following:
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>
 *    Random-accessible list of headers.
 *    a header is a representation of an element inside
 *    &lt;soap:Header>.
 *    It can be read multiple times,
 *    can be added or removed, but it is not modifiable.
 *    See {@link HeaderList} for more about headers.
 *
 * <li>
 *    The payload of the message, which is a representation
 *    of an element inside &lt;soap:Body>.
 *    the payload is streamed, and therefore it can be
 *    only read once (or can be only written to something once.)
 *    once a payload is used, a message is said to be <b>consumed</b>.
 *    A message {@link #hasPayload() may not have any payload.}
 *
 * <li>
 *    Attachments.
 *    TODO: can attachments be streamed? I suspect so.
 *    does anyone need to read attachment twice?
 *
 * </ol>
 *
 *
 * <h2>How does this abstraction work?</h2>
 * <p>
 * The basic idea behind the {@link Message} is to hide the actual
 * data representation. For example, a {@link Message} might be
 * constructed on top of an {@link InputStream} from the accepted HTTP connection,
 * or it might be constructed on top of a JAXB object as a result
 * of the method invocation through {@link Proxy}. There will be
 * a {@link Message} implementation for each of those cases.
 *
 * <p>
 * This interface provides a lot of methods that access the payload
 * in many different forms, and implementations can implement those
 * methods in the best possible way.
 *
 * <p>
 * A particular attention is paid to make sure that a {@link Message}
 * object can be constructed on a stream that is not fully read yet.
 * We believe this improves the turn-around time on the server side.
 *
 * <p>
 * It is often useful to wrap a {@link Message} into another {@link Message},
 * for example to encrypt the body, or to verify the signature as the body
 * is read.
 *
 * <p>
 * This representation is also used for a REST-ful XML message.
 * In such case we'll construct a {@link Message} with empty
 * attachments and headers, and when serializing all headers
 * and attachments will be ignored.
 *
 *
 *
 * <h2>Message and XOP</h2>
 * <p>
 * XOP is considered as an {@link Codec}, and therefore when you are looking at
 * {@link Message}, you'll never see &lt;xop:Include> or any such elements
 * (instead you'll see the base64 data inlined.) If a consumer of infoset isn't
 * interested in handling XOP by himself, this allows him to work with XOP
 * correctly even without noticing it.
 *
 * <p>
 * For producers and consumers that are interested in accessing the binary data
 * more efficiently, they can use {@link XMLStreamReaderEx} and
 * {@link XMLStreamWriterEx}.
 *
 *
 *
 * <h2>Message lifespan</h2>
 * <p>
 * Often {@link Packet} include information local to a particular
 * invocaion (such as {@code HttpServletRequest}, from this angle, it makes sense
 * to tie a lifespan of a message to one pipeline invocation.
 * <p>
 * On the other hand, if you think about WS-RM, it often needs to hold on to
 * a message longer than a pipeline invocation (you might get an HTTP request,
 * get a message X, get a second HTTP request, get another message Y, and
 * only then you might want to process X.)
 * <p>
 * TODO: what do we do about this?
 *
 *
 * <pre>
 * TODO: can body element have foreign attributes? maybe ID for security?
 *       Yes, when the SOAP body is signed there will be an ID attribute present
 *       But in this case any security based impl may need access
 *       to the concrete representation.
 * TODO: HTTP headers?
 *       Yes. Abstracted as transport-based properties.
 * TODO: who handles SOAP 1.1 and SOAP 1.2 difference?
 *       As separate channel implementations responsible for the creation of the
 *       message?
 * TODO: session?
 * TODO: Do we need to expose SOAPMessage explicitly?
 *       SOAPMessage could be the concrete representation but is it necessary to
 *       transform between different concrete representations?
 *       Perhaps this comes down to how use channels for creation and processing.
 * TODO: Do we need to distinguish better between creation and processing?
 *       Do we really need the requirement that a created message can be resused
 *       for processing. Shall we bifurcate?
 *
 * TODO: SOAP version issue
 *       SOAP version is determined by the context, so message itself doesn't carry it around (?)
 *
 * TODO: wrapping message needs easier. in particular properties and attachments.
 * </pre>

     * Creates a copy of a {@link Message}.
     *
     * <p>
     * This method creates a new {@link Message} whose header/payload/attachments/properties
     * are identical to this {@link Message}. Once created, the created {@link Message}
     * and the original {@link Message} behaves independently --- adding header/
     * attachment to one {@link Message} doesn't affect another {@link Message}
     * at all.
     *
     * <p>
     * This method does <b>NOT</b> consume a message.
     *
     * <p>
     * To enable efficient copy operations, there's a few restrictions on
     * how copied message can be used.
     *
     * <ol>
     *  <li>The original and the copy may not be
     *      used concurrently by two threads (this allows two {@link Message}s
     *      to share some internal resources, such as JAXB marshallers.)
     *      Note that it's OK for the original and the copy to be processed
     *      by two threads, as long as they are not concurrent.
     *
     *  <li>The copy has the same 'life scope'
     *      as the original (this allows shallower copy, such as
     *      JAXB beans wrapped in {@link JAXBMessage}.)
     * </ol>
     *
     * <p>
     * A 'life scope' of a message created during a message processing
     * in a pipeline is until a pipeline processes the next message.
     * A message cannot be kept beyond its life scope.
     *
     * (This experimental design is to allow message objects to be reused
     * --- feedback appreciated.)
     *
     *
     *
     * <h3>Design Rationale</h3>
     * <p>
     * Since a {@link Message} body is read-once, sometimes
     * (such as when you do fail-over, or WS-RM) you need to
     * create an idential copy of a {@link Message}.
     *
     * <p>
     * The actual copy operation depends on the layout
     * of the data in memory, hence it's best to be done by
     * the {@link Message} implementation itself.
     *
     * <p>
     * The restrictions placed on the use of copied {@link Message} can be
     * relaxed if necessary, but it will make the copy method more expensive.
