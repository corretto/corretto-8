// Generate the self-patching vtable method:
//
// This method will be called (as any other Klass virtual method) with
// the Klass itself as the first argument.  Example:
//
//      oop obj;
//      int size = obj->klass()->oop_size(this);
//
// for which the virtual method call is Klass::oop_size();
//
// The dummy method is called with the Klass object as the first
// operand, and an object as the second argument.
//

//=====================================================================

// All of the dummy methods in the vtable are essentially identical,
// differing only by an ordinal constant, and they bear no relationship
// to the original method which the caller intended. Also, there needs
// to be 'vtbl_list_size' instances of the vtable in order to
// differentiate between the 'vtable_list_size' original Klass objects.
