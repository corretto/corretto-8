Usage: jar {ctxui}[vfmn0PMe] [jar-file] [manifest-file] [entry-point] [-C dir] files ...\n\
Options:\n\
\ \   -c  create new archive\n\
\ \   -t  list table of contents for archive\n\
\ \   -x  extract named (or all) files from archive\n\
\ \   -u  update existing archive\n\
\ \   -v  generate verbose output on standard output\n\
\ \   -f  specify archive file name\n\
\ \   -m  include manifest information from specified manifest file\n\
\ \   -n  perform Pack200 normalization after creating a new archive\n\
\ \   -e  specify application entry point for stand-alone application \n\
\ \       bundled into an executable jar file\n\
\ \   -0  store only; use no ZIP compression\n\
\ \   -P  preserve leading '/' (absolute path) and ".." (parent directory) components from file names\n\
\ \   -M  do not create a manifest file for the entries\n\
\ \   -i  generate index information for the specified jar files\n\
\ \   -C  change to the specified directory and include the following file\n\
If any file is a directory then it is processed recursively.\n\
The manifest file name, the archive file name and the entry point name are\n\
specified in the same order as the 'm', 'f' and 'e' flags.\n\n\
Example 1: to archive two class files into an archive called classes.jar: \n\
\ \      jar cvf classes.jar Foo.class Bar.class \n\
Example 2: use an existing manifest file 'mymanifest' and archive all the\n\
\ \          files in the foo/ directory into 'classes.jar': \n\
\ \      jar cvfm classes.jar mymanifest -C foo/ .\n
