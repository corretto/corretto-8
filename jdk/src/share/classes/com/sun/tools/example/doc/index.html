    <h1>Example JDI Applications</h1>
This example download contains the source code and
documentation for three applications written using
the Java<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> Debug Interface (JDI)
of the <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/products/jpda">Java Platform Debugger Architecture</A> (JPDA).
They are provided as educational tools and as starting
points for debugger development.
<P>
In increasing order of complexity:
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="trace.html">Trace</A> displays traces
of program execution.  It is very simple (less than 600 lines)
yet uses most of the basic JDI functionality.  It is a
good starting point.
<LI><A HREF="jdb.html">Jdb</A> is the command line debugger
distributed with the J2SE SDK.
<LI><A HREF="javadt.html">Javadt</A> is the beginnings of
a GUI debugger.
</UL>
<P>
Trace is in the <code>trace</code> directory. 
Jdb and Javadt share a package, and are under the 
<code>debug</code> directory.

<H4>Where is JPDA?</H4>
New versions of the J2SE SDK have JPDA included.  For
older versions JPDA must be separately downloaded.
<DL>
  <DT>SDKs with JPDA included
  <DD>J2SE SDK v1.3 and later and J2SE SDK for Linux v1.2.2
  <DT>SDKs requiring JPDA download
  <DD>J2SE SDK v1.2.1 and v1.2.2 for Solaris and Windows
  <DT>Other SDKs
  <DD>Check with vendor
</DL>
<P>
<H4>Set-up for J2SE SDKs with JPDA included</H4>
Your classpath must include the JDI Library code, which is
in <code>tools.jar</code> in the <code>lib</code> directory.
This is needed for both compiling the example code and 
executing it.
<p>
<H4>Set-up for J2SE SDKs without JPDA - Solaris</H4>
Download JPDA v1.0 from 
<A HREF="http://java.sun.com/products/jpda">http://java.sun.com/products/jpda</A>.  Follow the 
<A HREF="http://java.sun.com/products/jpda/installinst.html">Installation Instructions</A>
found there.  Pay particular attention to setting the library
path.
<P>
Your classpath must include the JDI Library code, which is
in <VAR>jpda_home</VAR>/<code>lib/tools.jar</code>.
This is needed for both compiling the example code and 
executing it.

to your path.
