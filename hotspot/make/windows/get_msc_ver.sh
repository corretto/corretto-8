# cl version 12.00.8804 returns "MSC_VER=1200"
# cl version 13.10.3077 returns "MSC_VER=1310"
# cl version 14.00.30701 returns "MSC_VER=1399" (OLD_MSSDK version)
# cl version 14.00.40310.41 returns "MSC_VER=1400"
# cl version 15.00.21022.8 returns "MSC_VER=1500"

# Note that we currently do not have a way to set HotSpotMksHome in
# the batch build, but so far this has not seemed to be a problem. The

# sh, and it has been found that sometimes `which sh` fails.
