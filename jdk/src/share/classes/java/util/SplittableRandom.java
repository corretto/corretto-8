/**
 * A generator of uniform pseudorandom values applicable for use in
 * (among other contexts) isolated parallel computations that may
 * generate subtasks. Class {@code SplittableRandom} supports methods for
 * producing pseudorandom numbers of type {@code int}, {@code long},
 * and {@code double} with similar usages as for class
 * {@link java.util.Random} but differs in the following ways:
 *
 * <ul>
 *
 * <li>Series of generated values pass the DieHarder suite testing
 * independence and uniformity properties of random number generators.
 * (Most recently validated with <a
 * href="http://www.phy.duke.edu/~rgb/General/dieharder.php"> version
 * 3.31.1</a>.) These tests validate only the methods for certain
 * types and ranges, but similar properties are expected to hold, at
 * least approximately, for others as well. The <em>period</em>
 * (length of any series of generated values before it repeats) is at
 * least 2<sup>64</sup>. </li>
 *
 * <li> Method {@link #split} constructs and returns a new
 * SplittableRandom instance that shares no mutable state with the
 * current instance. However, with very high probability, the
 * values collectively generated by the two objects have the same
 * statistical properties as if the same quantity of values were
 * generated by a single thread using a single {@code
 * SplittableRandom} object.  </li>
 *
 * <li>Instances of SplittableRandom are <em>not</em> thread-safe.
 * They are designed to be split, not shared, across threads. For
 * example, a {@link java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinTask
 * fork/join-style} computation using random numbers might include a
 * construction of the form {@code new
 * Subtask(aSplittableRandom.split()).fork()}.
 *
 * <li>This class provides additional methods for generating random
 * streams, that employ the above techniques when used in {@code
 * stream.parallel()} mode.</li>
 *
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Instances of {@code SplittableRandom} are not cryptographically
 * secure.  Consider instead using {@link java.security.SecureRandom}
 * in security-sensitive applications. Additionally,
 * default-constructed instances do not use a cryptographically random
 * seed unless the {@linkplain System#getProperty system property}
 * {@code java.util.secureRandomSeed} is set to {@code true}.

    /*
     * Implementation Overview.
     *
     * This algorithm was inspired by the "DotMix" algorithm by
     * Leiserson, Schardl, and Sukha "Deterministic Parallel
     * Random-Number Generation for Dynamic-Multithreading Platforms",
     * PPoPP 2012, as well as those in "Parallel random numbers: as
     * easy as 1, 2, 3" by Salmon, Morae, Dror, and Shaw, SC 2011.  It
     * differs mainly in simplifying and cheapening operations.
     *
     * The primary update step (method nextSeed()) is to add a
     * constant ("gamma") to the current (64 bit) seed, forming a
     * simple sequence.  The seed and the gamma values for any two
     * SplittableRandom instances are highly likely to be different.
     *
     * Methods nextLong, nextInt, and derivatives do not return the
     * sequence (seed) values, but instead a hash-like bit-mix of
     * their bits, producing more independently distributed sequences.
     * For nextLong, the mix64 function is based on David Stafford's
     * (http://zimbry.blogspot.com/2011/09/better-bit-mixing-improving-on.html)
     * "Mix13" variant of the "64-bit finalizer" function in Austin
     * Appleby's MurmurHash3 algorithm (see
     * http://code.google.com/p/smhasher/wiki/MurmurHash3). The mix32
     * function is based on Stafford's Mix04 mix function, but returns
     * the upper 32 bits cast as int.
     *
     * The split operation uses the current generator to form the seed
     * and gamma for another SplittableRandom.  To conservatively
     * avoid potential correlations between seed and value generation,
     * gamma selection (method mixGamma) uses different
     * (Murmurhash3's) mix constants.  To avoid potential weaknesses
     * in bit-mixing transformations, we restrict gammas to odd values
     * with at least 24 0-1 or 1-0 bit transitions.  Rather than
     * rejecting candidates with too few or too many bits set, method
     * mixGamma flips some bits (which has the effect of mapping at
     * most 4 to any given gamma value).  This reduces the effective
     * set of 64bit odd gamma values by about 2%, and serves as an
     * automated screening for sequence constant selection that is
     * left as an empirical decision in some other hashing and crypto
     * algorithms.
     *
     * The resulting generator thus transforms a sequence in which
     * (typically) many bits change on each step, with an inexpensive
     * mixer with good (but less than cryptographically secure)
     * avalanching.
     *
     * The default (no-argument) constructor, in essence, invokes
     * split() for a common "defaultGen" SplittableRandom.  Unlike
     * other cases, this split must be performed in a thread-safe
     * manner, so we use an AtomicLong to represent the seed rather
     * than use an explicit SplittableRandom. To bootstrap the
     * defaultGen, we start off using a seed based on current time
     * unless the java.util.secureRandomSeed property is set. This
     * serves as a slimmed-down (and insecure) variant of SecureRandom
     * that also avoids stalls that may occur when using /dev/random.
     *
     * It is a relatively simple matter to apply the basic design here
     * to use 128 bit seeds. However, emulating 128bit arithmetic and
     * carrying around twice the state add more overhead than appears
     * warranted for current usages.
     *
     * File organization: First the non-public methods that constitute
     * the main algorithm, then the main public methods, followed by
     * some custom spliterator classes needed for stream methods.
