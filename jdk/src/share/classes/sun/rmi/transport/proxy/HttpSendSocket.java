/**
 * The HttpSendSocket class extends the java.net.Socket class
 * by enclosing the data output stream in, then extracting the input
 * stream from, an HTTP protocol transmission.
 *
 * NOTES:
 *
 * Since the length of the output request must be known before the
 * HTTP header can be completed, all of the output is buffered by
 * an HttpOutputStream object until either an attempt is made to
 * read from this socket, or the socket is explicitly closed.
 *
 * On the first read attempt to read from this socket, the buffered
 * output is sent to the destination as the body of an HTTP POST
 * request.  All reads will then acquire data from the body of
 * the response.  A subsequent attempt to write to this socket will
 * throw an IOException.
