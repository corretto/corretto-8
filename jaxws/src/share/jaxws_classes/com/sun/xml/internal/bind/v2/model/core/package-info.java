/**
 * The in-memory model of the JAXB-bound beans.
 *
 * <h2>Parameterizations</h2>
 * <p>
 * Interfaces in this package are parameterized to work with arbitrary Java reflection library.
 * This is necessary because the RI needs to work with both the runtime reflection library
 * ({@link java.lang.reflect}) and the Annotation Processing.
 *
 * <p>
 * The meaning of parameterizations are as follows:
 *
 * <dl>
 *  <dt><b>T</b>
 *  <dd>Represents an use of type, such as {@code int}, {@code Foo[]}, or {@code List<Foo>}.
 *      Corresponds to {@link Type}.
 *
 *  <dt><b>C</b>
 *  <dd>Represents a declaration of a type (that is, class, interface, enum, or annotation.)
 *      This doesn't include {@code int}, {@code Foo[]}, or {@code List<Foo>}, because
 *      they don't have corresponding declarations.
 *      Corresponds to {@link Class} (roughly).
 *
 *  <dt><b>F</b>
 *  <dd>Represents a field.
 *      Corresponds to {@link Field}.
 *
 *  <dt><b>M</b>
 *  <dd>Represents a method.
 *      Corresponds to {@link Method}.
 *
 * <dt>
