/**
 * The PreDestroy annotation is used on methods as a callback notification to
 * signal that the instance is in the process of being removed by the
 * container. The method annotated with PreDestroy is typically used to
 * release resources that it has been holding. This annotation MUST be
 * supported by all container managed objects that support PostConstruct
 * except the application client container in Java EE 5. The method on which
 * the PreDestroy annotation is applied MUST fulfill all of the following
 * criteria:
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>The method MUST NOT have any parameters except in the case of
 * interceptors in which case it takes an InvocationContext object as
 * defined by the Interceptors specification.</li>
 * <li>The method defined on an interceptor class MUST HAVE one of the
 * following signatures:
 * <p>
 * void &#060;METHOD&#062;(InvocationContext)
 * <p>
 * Object &#060;METHOD&#062;(InvocationContext) throws Exception
 * <p>
 * <i>Note: A PreDestroy interceptor method must not throw application
 * exceptions, but it may be declared to throw checked exceptions including
 * the java.lang.Exception if the same interceptor method interposes on
 * business or timeout methods in addition to lifecycle events. If a
 * PreDestroy interceptor method returns a value, it is ignored by
 * the container.</i>
 * </li>
 * <li>The method defined on a non-interceptor class MUST HAVE the
 * following signature:
 * <p>
 * void &#060;METHOD&#062;()
 * </li>
 * <li>The method on which PreDestroy is applied MAY be public, protected,
 * package private or private.</li>
 * <li>The method MUST NOT be static.</li>
 * <li>The method MAY be final.</li>
 * <li>If the method throws an unchecked exception it is ignored except in the
 * case of EJBs where the EJB can handle exceptions.</li>
 * </ul>
