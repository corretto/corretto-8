<p>
The Java&trade; programming language compiler API is a set of interfaces that describes the
functions provided by a compiler.  This API has three
main objectives:
</p>

<ul>

<li>Allow invocation of a compiler from a program using
standardized interfaces.</li>

<li>Provide interfaces enabling the compiler to report diagnostics in a
structured way.</li>

<li>Provide interfaces enabling clients of the compiler to override
how file objects are found.  "File objects" is a file
abstraction.</li>

</ul>
