Provides the classes necessary to create an applet and the classes an applet
uses to communicate with its applet context.
<p>
The applet framework involves two
entities: the <i>applet</i> and the <i>applet context</i>. An applet is an 
embeddable window (see the Panel class) with a few extra methods that the applet 
context can use to initialize, start, and stop the applet.
<p>
The applet context is an application that is responsible for loading and running
applets. For example, the applet context could be a Web browser or an applet
development environment.
