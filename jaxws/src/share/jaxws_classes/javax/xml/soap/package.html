    Provides the API for creating and building SOAP messages. This package
 is defined in the <i>SOAP with Attachments API for Java<sup><font
 size="-2">TM</font></sup> (SAAJ) 1.3</i> specification.
<p> The API in the <code>javax.xml.soap</code> package allows you to do the
 following: </p>

<ul>
     <li>create a point-to-point connection to a specified endpoint   </li>
    <li>create a SOAP message   </li>
    <li>create an XML fragment   </li>
    <li>add content to the header of a SOAP message   </li>
    <li>add content to the body of a SOAP message   </li>
    <li>create attachment parts and add content to them   </li>
    <li>access/add/modify parts of a SOAP message   </li>
    <li>create/add/modify SOAP fault information   </li>
    <li>extract content from a SOAP message   </li>
    <li>send a SOAP request-response message   </li>

</ul>

<p>   <!-- <h2>Package Specification</h2> -->  <!-- The SAAJ 1.1 specification gives an overview of the  -->
 <!-- <code>javax.xml.soap</code> package and --> <!-- explains how its classes and interfaces work. -->

In addition the APIs in the <code>javax.xml.soap</code> package extend
their  counterparts in the <code>org.w3c.dom</code> package. This means that
the  <code>SOAPPart</code> of a <code>SOAPMessage</code> is also a DOM Level
2 <code>Document</code>, and can be manipulated as such by applications,
tools and libraries that use DOM (see http://www.w3.org/DOM/ for more information).
It is important to note that, while it is possible to use DOM APIs to add
ordinary DOM nodes to a SAAJ tree, the SAAJ APIs are still required to return
SAAJ types when examining or manipulating the tree. In order to accomplish
this the SAAJ APIs (specifically {@link javax.xml.soap.SOAPElement#getChildElements()})
are allowed to silently replace objects that are incorrectly typed relative
to SAAJ requirements with equivalent objects of the required type. These
replacements must never cause the logical structure of the tree to change,
so from the perspective of the DOM APIs the tree will remain unchanged. However,
the physical composition of the tree will have changed so that references
to the nodes that were replaced will refer to nodes that are no longer a
part of the tree. The SAAJ APIs are not allowed to make these replacements
if they are not required so the replacement objects will never subsequently
be silently replaced by future calls to the SAAJ API.
<p>
What this means in
practical terms is that an application that starts to use SAAJ APIs on a
tree after manipulating it using DOM APIs must assume that the tree has been
translated into an all SAAJ tree and that any references to objects within
the tree that were obtained using DOM APIs are no longer valid. Switching
from SAAJ APIs to DOM APIs is not allowed to cause invalid references and
neither is using SAAJ APIs exclusively. It is only switching from using DOM
APIs on a particular SAAJ tree to using SAAJ APIs that causes the risk of
invalid references.<br>
