/**
 * Implementation of {@link com.sun.xml.internal.org.jvnet.staxex.StreamingDataHandler} to access MIME
 * attachments efficiently. Applications can use the additional methods and decide
 * on how to access the attachment data in JAX-WS applications.
 *
 * <p>
 * for e.g.:
 *
 * DataHandler dh = proxy.getData();
 * StreamingDataHandler sdh = (StreamingDataHandler)dh;
 * // readOnce() doesn't store attachment on the disk in some cases
 * // for e.g when only one huge attachment after soap envelope part in MIME message
 * InputStream in = sdh.readOnce();
 * ...
 * in.close();
 * sdh.close();
