 Provides support for the  marshalling of value types.  Value type
 marshalling may require access to an implementation of the value type or
 to meta information about the value type.  This information is passed
 between the sending context and the receiving context using a particular
 service context containing an instance of the
 <code>SendingContext.RunTime</code> interface.
 <P>
 A sending context may be either the client side or the server side of
 an invocation, depending on which contains a value type.
 The sending context is the client side of an
 invocation if the request contains a value type. It is the server side
 if the reply contains a value type.  The other party in the communication
 is the receiving context.
 <P>
 The service context marshalled for <code>SendingContext</code>
 consists of an encapsulated IOR for the <code>SendingContext.RunTime</code>
 interface.  <code>RunTime</code> is just a marker
 interface defined to allow extensibility in the future.  There is
 currently only one subinterface of <code>RunTime</code> defined:
 the <code>SendingContext.CodeBase</code> interface.
 The interface <code>CodeBase</code> defines operations to obtain code URLs
 and meta-information about a value type received from the sending
 context.
 <P>
 Note that these classes are currently defined in the
 <code>com.sun.org.omg.SendingContext</code>
 package rather than in the package <code>org.omg.SendingContext</code>.
 This has been done to avoid including large parts of the interface
 repository in the JDK core, since the interface repository is still
 evolving in response to the needs of the CORBA Components work.
