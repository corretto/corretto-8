/**
 * The class {@code StrictMath} contains methods for performing basic
 * numeric operations such as the elementary exponential, logarithm,
 * square root, and trigonometric functions.
 *
 * <p>To help ensure portability of Java programs, the definitions of
 * some of the numeric functions in this package require that they
 * produce the same results as certain published algorithms. These
 * algorithms are available from the well-known network library
 * {@code netlib} as the package "Freely Distributable Math
 * Library," <a
 * href="ftp://ftp.netlib.org/fdlibm.tar">{@code fdlibm}</a>. These
 * algorithms, which are written in the C programming language, are
 * then to be understood as executed with all floating-point
 * operations following the rules of Java floating-point arithmetic.
 *
 * <p>The Java math library is defined with respect to
 * {@code fdlibm} version 5.3. Where {@code fdlibm} provides
 * more than one definition for a function (such as
 * {@code acos}), use the "IEEE 754 core function" version
 * (residing in a file whose name begins with the letter
 * {@code e}).  The methods which require {@code fdlibm}
 * semantics are {@code sin}, {@code cos}, {@code tan},
 * {@code asin}, {@code acos}, {@code atan},
 * {@code exp}, {@code log}, {@code log10},
 * {@code cbrt}, {@code atan2}, {@code pow},
 * {@code sinh}, {@code cosh}, {@code tanh},
 * {@code hypot}, {@code expm1}, and {@code log1p}.
 *
 * <p>
 * The platform uses signed two's complement integer arithmetic with
 * int and long primitive types.  The developer should choose
 * the primitive type to ensure that arithmetic operations consistently
 * produce correct results, which in some cases means the operations
 * will not overflow the range of values of the computation.
 * The best practice is to choose the primitive type and algorithm to avoid
 * overflow. In cases where the size is {@code int} or {@code long} and
 * overflow errors need to be detected, the methods {@code addExact},
 * {@code subtractExact}, {@code multiplyExact}, and {@code toIntExact}
 * throw an {@code ArithmeticException} when the results overflow.
 * For other arithmetic operations such as divide, absolute value,
 * increment, decrement, and negation overflow occurs only with
 * a specific minimum or maximum value and should be checked against
 * the minimum or maximum as appropriate.

     * value sets.  If the exponent of the result is between {@link

     * is subnormal, {@code scalb(scalb(x, n), -n)} may not equal
