# tzdb data for proposed US election time (this file is obsolete)

# This file is in the public domain, so clarified as of
# 2009-05-17 by Arthur David Olson.

# From Arthur David Olson (1989-04-05):
# On 1989-04-05, the U. S. House of Representatives passed (238-154) a bill
# establishing "Pacific Presidential Election Time"; it was not acted on
# by the Senate or signed into law by the President.
# You might want to change the "PE" (Presidential Election) below to
# "Q" (Quadrennial) to maintain three-character zone abbreviations.
# If you're really conservative, you might want to change it to "D".
# Avoid "L" (Leap Year), which won't be true in 2100.

# If Presidential Election Time is ever established, replace "XXXX" below
# with the year the law takes effect and uncomment the "##" lines.
