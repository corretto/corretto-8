The unit tests in this directory depend on a native launcher library
(libLauncher.so). This native library is built off-line and the
resulting libLauncher.so for each processor/OS combination is checked
into the workspace. The reason for this is because the test environment
may not have the required compilers/build environment.

In order to rebuild libLauncher.so the following is required :-

1. Check-out each of the shared libraries (sccs edit)

2. Edit Launcher.c with the appropriate changes

3. Execute the make script (gnumake all) on each processor/OS so
that the appropriate lib/<platform>/libLauncher.so is built.

4. Test the changes

5. Check-in each of the shared library (sccs delget)


For step 4 (re-building libLauncher.so) the following environment is required:

(a) JAVA_HOME needs to be set to J2SE directory, eg:-
	export JAVA_HOME=/usr/local/java/jdk1.5/solaris-sparc

(b) For Solaris the SOS8 'cc' needs to be on the PATH, check using:
	# cc -V
	cc: Sun C 5.5 2003/03/12

(c) Execute the make script :-
	Solaris:	gnumake all
	Linux:		gmake all
