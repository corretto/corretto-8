Classes for generating and validating XML digital
signatures. This package includes classes that represent the core elements 
defined in the W3C XML digital signature specification:
{@link javax.xml.crypto.dsig.XMLSignature XMLSignature},
{@link javax.xml.crypto.dsig.SignedInfo SignedInfo},
{@link javax.xml.crypto.dsig.CanonicalizationMethod CanonicalizationMethod},
{@link javax.xml.crypto.dsig.SignatureMethod SignatureMethod},
{@link javax.xml.crypto.dsig.Reference Reference}, 
{@link javax.xml.crypto.dsig.DigestMethod DigestMethod},
{@link javax.xml.crypto.dsig.XMLObject XMLObject}, 
{@link javax.xml.crypto.dsig.Manifest Manifest},
{@link javax.xml.crypto.dsig.SignatureProperties SignatureProperties}, and
{@link javax.xml.crypto.dsig.SignatureProperty SignatureProperty}. 
<code>KeyInfo</code> types
are defined in the {@link javax.xml.crypto.dsig.keyinfo} subpackage.
{@link javax.xml.crypto.dsig.XMLSignatureFactory XMLSignatureFactory}
is an abstract factory that creates 
{@link javax.xml.crypto.dsig.XMLSignature XMLSignature} objects from scratch
or from a pre-existing XML representation, such as a DOM node.
{@link javax.xml.crypto.dsig.TransformService} is a service provider
interface for creating and plugging in implementations of
transform and canonicalization algorithms.

<p>Of primary significance in this package is the 
{@link javax.xml.crypto.dsig.XMLSignature XMLSignature} class,
which allows you to sign and validate an XML digital signature.
