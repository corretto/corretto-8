/**
 * JAXP {@link javax.xml.transform.Result} implementation
 * that unmarshals a JAXB object.
 *
 * <p>
 * This utility class is useful to combine JAXB with
 * other Java/XML technologies.
 *
 * <p>
 * The following example shows how to use JAXB to unmarshal a document
 * resulting from an XSLT transformation.
 *
 * <blockquote>
 *    <pre>
 *       JAXBResult result = new JAXBResult(
 *         JAXBContext.newInstance("org.acme.foo") );
 *
 *       // set up XSLT transformation
 *       TransformerFactory tf = TransformerFactory.newInstance();
 *       Transformer t = tf.newTransformer(new StreamSource("test.xsl"));
 *
 *       // run transformation
 *       t.transform(new StreamSource("document.xml"),result);
 *
 *       // obtain the unmarshalled content tree
 *       Object o = result.getResult();
 *    </pre>
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * <p>
 * The fact that JAXBResult derives from SAXResult is an implementation
 * detail. Thus in general applications are strongly discouraged from
 * accessing methods defined on SAXResult.
 *
 * <p>
 * In particular it shall never attempt to call the setHandler,
 * setLexicalHandler, and setSystemId methods.
