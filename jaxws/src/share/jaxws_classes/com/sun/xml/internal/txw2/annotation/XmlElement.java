/**
 * Specifies the name of the XML element.
 *
 * <h2>Used on method</h2>
 * <p>
 * When used on methods declared on interfaces that derive
 * from {@link TypedXmlWriter}, it specifies that the invocation
 * of the method will produce an element of the specified name.
 *
 * <p>
 * The method signature has to match one of the following patterns.
 *
 * <dl>
 *  <dt>Child writer: <tt>TW foo()</tt></dt>
 *  <dd>TW must be an interface derived from {@link TypedXmlWriter}.
 *      When this method is called, a new child element is started,
 *      and its content can be written by using the returned <tt>TW</tt>
 *      object. This child element will be ended when its _commit method
 *      is called.
 *  <dt>Leaf element: <tt>void foo(DT1,DT2,...)</tt></dt>
 *  <dd>DTi must be datatype objects.
 *      When this method is called, a new child element is started,
 *      followed by the whitespace-separated text data from each of
 *      the datatype objects, followed by the end tag.
 * </dl>
 *
 * <h2>Used on interface</h2>
 * <p>
 * When used on interfaces that derive from {@link TypedXmlWriter},
 * it associates an element name with that interface. This name is
 * used in a few places, such as in {@link TXW#create(Class,XmlSerializer)}
 * and {@link TypedXmlWriter#_element(Class)}.
