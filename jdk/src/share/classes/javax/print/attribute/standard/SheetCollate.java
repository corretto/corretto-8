/**
 * Class SheetCollate is a printing attribute class, an enumeration, that
 * specifies whether or not the media sheets of each copy of each printed
 * document in a job are to be in sequence, when multiple copies of the document
 * are specified by the {@link Copies Copies} attribute. When SheetCollate is
 * COLLATED, each copy of each document is printed with the print-stream sheets
 * in sequence. When SheetCollate is UNCOLLATED, each print-stream sheet is
 * printed a number of times equal to the value of the {@link Copies Copies}
 * attribute in succession. For example, suppose a document produces two media
 * sheets as output, {@link Copies Copies} is 6, and SheetCollate is UNCOLLATED;
 * in this case six copies of the first media sheet are printed followed by
 * six copies of the second media sheet.
 * <P>
 * Whether the effect of sheet collation is achieved by placing copies of a
 * document in multiple output bins or in the same output bin with
 * implementation defined document separation is implementation dependent.
 * Also whether it is achieved by making multiple passes over the job or by
 * using an output sorter is implementation dependent.
 * <P>
 * If a printer does not support the SheetCollate attribute (meaning the client
 * cannot specify any particular sheet collation), the printer must behave as
 * though SheetCollate were always set to COLLATED.
 * <P>
 * The SheetCollate attribute interacts with the {@link MultipleDocumentHandling
 * MultipleDocumentHandling} attribute. The {@link MultipleDocumentHandling
 * MultipleDocumentHandling} attribute describes the collation of entire
 * documents, and the SheetCollate attribute describes the semantics of
 * collating individual pages within a document.
 * <P>
 * The effect of a SheetCollate attribute on a multidoc print job (a job with
 * multiple documents) depends on whether all the docs have the same sheet
 * collation specified or whether different docs have different sheet
 * collations specified, and on the (perhaps defaulted) value of the {@link
 * MultipleDocumentHandling MultipleDocumentHandling} attribute.
 * <UL>
 * <LI>
 * If all the docs have the same sheet collation specified, then the following
 * combinations of SheetCollate and {@link MultipleDocumentHandling
 * MultipleDocumentHandling} are permitted, and the printer reports an error
 * when the job is submitted if any other combination is specified:
 * <UL>
 * <LI>
 * SheetCollate = COLLATED, {@link MultipleDocumentHandling
 * MultipleDocumentHandling} = SINGLE_DOCUMENT -- All the input docs will be
 * combined into one output document. Multiple copies of the output document
 * will be produced with pages in collated order, i.e. pages 1, 2, 3, . . .,
 * 1, 2, 3, . . .
 * <P>
 * <LI>
 * SheetCollate = COLLATED, {@link MultipleDocumentHandling
 * MultipleDocumentHandling} = SINGLE_DOCUMENT_NEW_SHEET -- All the input docs
 * will be combined into one output document, and the first impression of each
 * input doc will always start on a new media sheet. Multiple copies of the
 * output document will be produced with pages in collated order, i.e. pages
 * 1, 2, 3, . . ., 1, 2, 3, . . .
 * <P>
 * <LI>
 * SheetCollate = COLLATED, {@link MultipleDocumentHandling
 * MultipleDocumentHandling} = SEPARATE_DOCUMENTS_UNCOLLATED_COPIES -- Each
 * input doc will remain a separate output document. Multiple copies of each
 * output document (call them A, B, . . .) will be produced with each document's
 * pages in collated order, but the documents themselves in uncollated order,
 * i.e. pages A1, A2, A3, . . ., A1, A2, A3, . . ., B1, B2, B3, . . ., B1, B2,
