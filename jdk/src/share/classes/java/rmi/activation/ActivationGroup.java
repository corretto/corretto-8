/**
 * An <code>ActivationGroup</code> is responsible for creating new
 * instances of "activatable" objects in its group, informing its
 * <code>ActivationMonitor</code> when either: its object's become
 * active or inactive, or the group as a whole becomes inactive. <p>
 *
 * An <code>ActivationGroup</code> is <i>initially</i> created in one
 * of several ways: <ul>
 * <li>as a side-effect of creating an <code>ActivationDesc</code>
 *     without an explicit <code>ActivationGroupID</code> for the
 *     first activatable object in the group, or
 * <li>via the <code>ActivationGroup.createGroup</code> method
 * <li>as a side-effect of activating the first object in a group
 *     whose <code>ActivationGroupDesc</code> was only registered.</ul><p>
 *
 * Only the activator can <i>recreate</i> an
 * <code>ActivationGroup</code>.  The activator spawns, as needed, a
 * separate VM (as a child process, for example) for each registered
 * activation group and directs activation requests to the appropriate
 * group. It is implementation specific how VMs are spawned. An
 * activation group is created via the
 * <code>ActivationGroup.createGroup</code> static method. The
 * <code>createGroup</code> method has two requirements on the group
 * to be created: 1) the group must be a concrete subclass of
 * <code>ActivationGroup</code>, and 2) the group must have a
 * constructor that takes two arguments:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li> the group's <code>ActivationGroupID</code>, and
 * <li> the group's initialization data (in a
 *      <code>java.rmi.MarshalledObject</code>)</ul><p>
 *
 * When created, the default implementation of
 * <code>ActivationGroup</code> will override the system properties
 * with the properties requested when its
 * <code>ActivationGroupDesc</code> was created, and will set a
 * {@link SecurityManager} as the default system
 * security manager.  If your application requires specific properties
 * to be set when objects are activated in the group, the application
 * should create a special <code>Properties</code> object containing
 * these properties, then create an <code>ActivationGroupDesc</code>
 * with the <code>Properties</code> object, and use
 * <code>ActivationGroup.createGroup</code> before creating any
 * <code>ActivationDesc</code>s (before the default
 * <code>ActivationGroupDesc</code> is created).  If your application
 * requires the use of a security manager other than
 * {@link SecurityManager}, in the
 * ActivativationGroupDescriptor properties list you can set
 * <code>java.security.manager</code> property to the name of the security
 * manager you would like to install.
