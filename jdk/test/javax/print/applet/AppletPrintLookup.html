     Wait until 5 applets have initialised and started and display string
     messages. Applet 0 and Applet 2 should find one less print service
     than the rest.
     Specifically all except Applets 0 and 2 should find a service called
     Applet N printer where N is the number of the applet. They should *NOT*
     find Applet M printer (where M != N).
