/**
 * This class implements a simple HTTP server. A HttpServer is bound to an IP address
 * and port number and listens for incoming TCP connections from clients on this address.
 * The sub-class {@link HttpsServer} implements a server which handles HTTPS requests.
 * <p>
 * One or more {@link HttpHandler} objects must be associated with a server
 * in order to process requests. Each such HttpHandler is registered
 * with a root URI path which represents the
 * location of the application or service on this server. The mapping of a handler
 * to a HttpServer is encapsulated by a {@link HttpContext} object. HttpContexts
 * are created by calling {@link #createContext(String,HttpHandler)}.
 * Any request for which no handler can be found is rejected with a 404 response.
 * Management of threads can be done external to this object by providing a
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.Executor} object. If none is provided a default
 * implementation is used.
 * <p>
 * <a name="mapping_description"></a>
 * <b>Mapping request URIs to HttpContext paths</b><p>
 * When a HTTP request is received,
 * the appropriate HttpContext (and handler) is located by finding the context
 * whose path is the longest matching prefix of the request URI's path.
 * Paths are matched literally, which means that the strings are compared
 * case sensitively, and with no conversion to or from any encoded forms.
 * For example. Given a HttpServer with the following HttpContexts configured.<p>
 * <table >
 * <tr><td><i>Context</i></td><td><i>Context path</i></td></tr>
 * <tr><td>ctx1</td><td>"/"</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>ctx2</td><td>"/apps/"</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>ctx3</td><td>"/apps/foo/"</td></tr>
 * </table>
 * <p>
 * the following table shows some request URIs and which, if any context they would
 * match with.<p>
 * <table>
 * <tr><td><i>Request URI</i></td><td><i>Matches context</i></td></tr>
 * <tr><td>"http://foo.com/apps/foo/bar"</td><td>ctx3</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>"http://foo.com/apps/Foo/bar"</td><td>no match, wrong case</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>"http://foo.com/apps/app1"</td><td>ctx2</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>"http://foo.com/foo"</td><td>ctx1</td></tr>
 * </table>
 * <p>
 * <b>Note about socket backlogs</b><p>
 * When binding to an address and port number, the application can also specify an integer
 * <i>backlog</i> parameter. This represents the maximum number of incoming TCP connections
 * which the system will queue internally. Connections are queued while they are waiting to
 * be accepted by the HttpServer. When the limit is reached, further connections may be
 * rejected (or possibly ignored) by the underlying TCP implementation. Setting the right
 * backlog value is a compromise between efficient resource usage in the TCP layer (not setting
 * it too high) and allowing adequate throughput of incoming requests (not setting it too low).
 * @since 1.6
