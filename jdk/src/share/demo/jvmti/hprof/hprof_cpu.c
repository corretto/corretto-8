#include "hprof.h"

/* This file contains the cpu loop for the option cpu=samples */

/* The cpu_loop thread basically waits for gdata->sample_interval millisecs
 *   then wakes up, and for each running thread it gets their stack trace,
 *   and updates the traces with 'hits'.
 *
 * No threads are suspended or resumed, and the thread sampling is in the
 *   file hprof_tls.c, which manages all active threads. The sampling
 *   technique (what is sampled) is also in hprof_tls.c.
 *
 * No adjustments are made to the pause time or sample interval except
 *   by the user via the interval=n option (default is 10ms).
 *
 * This thread can cause havoc when started prematurely or not terminated
 *   properly, see cpu_sample_init() and cpu_term(), and their calls in hprof_init.c.
 *
 * The listener loop (hprof_listener.c) can dynamically turn on or off the
 *  sampling of all or selected threads.
