The Nashorn repo is in the process of being migrated to OpenJDK and as such is
incomplete in several areas.

- The build system is not fully integrated.  When complete, Nashorn will be
installed in its proper location in the JRE.

- Once integrated, the correct version of the JDK will be wrapped around 
Nashorn.  In the meantime, ensure you use JDK8 b68 or later.

- The jjs tool has not been implemented in binary form yet.  Use "sh bin/jjs" 
(or bin/jjs.bat on windows) in the interm.

- The Dynalink component is not fully integrated into Nashorn as yet, but will
be when details are finalized.

- And, finally Nashorn is still in development.  To stay up to date, subscribe
