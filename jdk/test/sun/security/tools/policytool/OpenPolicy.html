This is a multi-stage test.  Click on "done" when you have completed
reading these instructions.<br><br>

First, policytool will be invoked.<br><br>

Pull down 'File' menu and select 'View Warning Log', which shows that
the default Policy File is not found. On Windows, if the file name
has the File separator character pointing the wrong way, like:<br><br>

C:\windows/java.policy<br><br>

Then the bug fix failed.
Otherwise, the bug fix succeeded.

Exit policytool.<br><br>

Press "Pass" if ... press "Fail" otherwise.<br><br>
