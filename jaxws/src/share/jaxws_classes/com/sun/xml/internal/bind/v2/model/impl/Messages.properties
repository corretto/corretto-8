ID_MUST_BE_STRING = \
    Property "{0}" has an XmlID annotation but its type is not String.

# {0} - field or field accessor (getter/setter) e.g.: foo.Bar#field has mutually exclusive annotations @javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlAttribute and @javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlElement OR foo.Bar#getField() has mutually exclusive annotations @javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlAttribute and @javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlElement

DUPLICATE_PROPERTIES = \
    There are two properties named "{0}"

XML_ELEMENT_MAPPING_ON_NON_IXMLELEMENT_METHOD = \
    The {0} method has @XmlElementMapping on it, but it doesn''t return a sub-type of JAXBElement.

# {0} - (xsd) type name. e.g. ns:MyType is not bound to a complex type, and therefore illegal as the scope.
SCOPE_IS_NOT_COMPLEXTYPE = \
    {0} is not bound to a complex type, and therefore illegal as the scope.

CONFLICTING_XML_ELEMENT_MAPPING = \
    The element name '{'{0}'}'{1} has more than one mapping.

    {0} has two properties with the @XmlAnyAttribute annotation.

SUPER_CLASS_HAS_WILDCARD = \
    Can''t have @XmlAnyAttribute when a base class has it already.

INVALID_ATTRIBUTE_WILDCARD_TYPE = \
    @XmlAnyAttribute is placed on a property whose type is {0} but it needs to be assignable to java.util.Map.

PROPERTY_MISSING_FROM_ORDER = \
    Property {0} is present but not specified in @XmlType.propOrder

PROPERTY_ORDER_CONTAINS_UNUSED_ENTRY = \
    Property {0} appears in @XmlType.propOrder, but no such property exists. Maybe you meant {1}?

# {1} - (local) type name e.g.: '#foo' is not a valid value for 'NCName'
INVALID_XML_ENUM_VALUE = \
    "{0}" is not a valid value for {1}.

FAILED_TO_INITIALE_DATATYPE_FACTORY = \
    Failed to initialize JAXP 1.3 DatatypeFactory class.

NO_IMAGE_WRITER = \
    No javax.imageio.ImageWriter is available for the specified MIME type "{0}"

    "{0}" is not a valid MIME type: {1}

ILLEGAL_ANNOTATION = \
    {0} annotation cannot be placed here

MULTIPLE_VALUE_PROPERTY = \
    @XmlValue is only allowed one per class, but two properties are annotated with @XmlValue.

XMLVALUE_IN_DERIVED_TYPE = \
    @XmlValue is not allowed on a class that derives another class.

ELEMENT_AND_VALUE_PROPERTY = \
    If a class has @XmlElement property, it cannot have @XmlValue property.

CONFLICTING_XML_TYPE_MAPPING = \
    Two classes have the same XML type name "{0}". Use @XmlType.name and @XmlType.namespace to \
    assign different names to them.

    Invalid @XmlElementRef : Type "{0}" or any of it's subclasses are not known to this context.

NO_XML_ELEMENT_DECL = \
    There''s no ObjectFactory with an @XmlElementDecl for the element '{'{0}'}'{1}.

    @XmlElementWrapper is only allowed on a collection property but "{0}" is not a collection property.

ANNOTATION_NOT_ALLOWED = \
    {0} annotation is not allowed on this kind of property.

XMLLIST_NEEDS_SIMPLETYPE = \
    {0} maps to a structured XML fragment (AKA complex type), and therefore incompatible with @XmlList.
