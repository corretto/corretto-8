/**
 * A <code>Soundbank</code> contains a set of <code>Instruments</code>
 * that can be loaded into a <code>Synthesizer</code>.
 * Note that a Java Sound <code>Soundbank</code> is different from a MIDI bank.
 * MIDI permits up to 16383 banks, each containing up to 128 instruments
 * (also sometimes called programs, patches, or timbres).
 * However, a <code>Soundbank</code> can contain 16383 times 128 instruments,
 * because the instruments within a <code>Soundbank</code> are indexed by both
 * a MIDI program number and a MIDI bank number (via a <code>Patch</code>
 * object). Thus, a <code>Soundbank</code> can be thought of as a collection
 * of MIDI banks.
 * <p>
 * <code>Soundbank</code> includes methods that return <code>String</code>
 * objects containing the sound bank's name, manufacturer, version number, and
 * description.  The precise content and format of these strings is left
 * to the implementor.
 * <p>
 * Different synthesizers use a variety of synthesis techniques.  A common
 * one is wavetable synthesis, in which a segment of recorded sound is
 * played back, often with looping and pitch change.  The Downloadable Sound
 * (DLS) format uses segments of recorded sound, as does the Headspace Engine.
 * <code>Soundbanks</code> and <code>Instruments</code> that are based on
 * wavetable synthesis (or other uses of stored sound recordings) should
 * typically implement the <code>getResources()</code>
 * method to provide access to these recorded segments.  This is optional,
 * however; the method can return an zero-length array if the synthesis technique
 * doesn't use sampled sound (FM synthesis and physical modeling are examples
 * of such techniques), or if it does but the implementor chooses not to make the
 * samples accessible.
