/**
 * The listener interface for receiving <code>WindowEvents</code>, including
 * <code>WINDOW_GAINED_FOCUS</code> and <code>WINDOW_LOST_FOCUS</code> events.
 * The class that is interested in processing a <code>WindowEvent</code>
 * either implements this interface (and
 * all the methods it contains) or extends the abstract
 * <code>WindowAdapter</code> class (overriding only the methods of interest).
 * The listener object created from that class is then registered with a
 * <code>Window</code>
 * using the <code>Window</code>'s <code>addWindowFocusListener</code> method.
 * When the <code>Window</code>'s
 * status changes by virtue of it being opened, closed, activated, deactivated,
 * iconified, or deiconified, or by focus being transfered into or out of the
 * <code>Window</code>, the relevant method in the listener object is invoked,
 * and the <code>WindowEvent</code> is passed to it.
