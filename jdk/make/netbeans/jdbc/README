Working on JDBC Using the NetBeans IDE

This JDBC NetBeans project allows a developer interested in making changes
to and/or fixing bugs in the JDBC source to modify, build, run and test
as well as generating the javadoc.

README FIRST

  make/netbeans/README to get started with NetBeans IDE and OpenJDK, and
  working with the OpenJDK NetBeans projects.

WORKING WITH JDBC

JDBC doesn't contain native code. You don't need to
have all the Java SE sources to work on JDBC but just the following subset:

            make/netbeans/ 
            src/share/classes/com/sun/rowset/
            src/share/classes/java/sql/
            src/share/classes/javax/sql/
            test/TEST.ROOT
            test/java/sql/
            test/javax/sql/

The set of actions supported by this project are:

* Build Project:

  - Compiles JDBC source files and puts the class files under
    build/${platform}-${arch}/classes.

  - Generates JDBC's jar file under dist/lib/jdbc.jar

    This new jar file could be used to patch an existing JDK installation
    by using -Xbootclasspath/p:$MYSRC/dist/lib/jdbc.jar

* Generate Javadoc for Project

  - Generates the javadoc for the JDBC source files,

  - The javadoc is generated under build/${platform}-${arch}/javadoc/jdbc.

* Test Project

  - Runs the JDBC jtreg unit tests located under test/java/sql or test/javax/sql.

  - The test results are written under

        build/${platform}-${arch}/jtreg/jdbc

    and the HTML test report can be found at

        build/${platform}-${arch}/jtreg/jdbc/JTreport/html/report.html



* Clean Project

  - Cleans the files created by this projet under build and dist.

IMPORTANT NOTE

  Please make sure to follow carefully the governance rules documented at
