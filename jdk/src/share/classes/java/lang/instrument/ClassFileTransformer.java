    /**
     * The implementation of this method may transform the supplied class file and
     * return a new replacement class file.
     *
     * <P>
     * There are two kinds of transformers, determined by the <code>canRetransform</code>
     * parameter of
     * {@link java.lang.instrument.Instrumentation#addTransformer(ClassFileTransformer,boolean)}:
     *  <ul>
     *    <li><i>retransformation capable</i> transformers that were added with
     *        <code>canRetransform</code> as true
     *    </li>
     *    <li><i>retransformation incapable</i> transformers that were added with
     *        <code>canRetransform</code> as false or where added with
     *        {@link java.lang.instrument.Instrumentation#addTransformer(ClassFileTransformer)}
     *    </li>
     *  </ul>
     *
     * <P>
     * Once a transformer has been registered with
     * {@link java.lang.instrument.Instrumentation#addTransformer(ClassFileTransformer,boolean)
     * addTransformer},
     * the transformer will be called for every new class definition and every class redefinition.
     * Retransformation capable transformers will also be called on every class retransformation.
     * The request for a new class definition is made with
     * {@link java.lang.ClassLoader#defineClass ClassLoader.defineClass}
     * or its native equivalents.
     * The request for a class redefinition is made with
     * {@link java.lang.instrument.Instrumentation#redefineClasses Instrumentation.redefineClasses}
     * or its native equivalents.
     * The request for a class retransformation is made with
     * {@link java.lang.instrument.Instrumentation#retransformClasses Instrumentation.retransformClasses}
     * or its native equivalents.
     * The transformer is called during the processing of the request, before the class file bytes
     * have been verified or applied.
     * When there are multiple transformers, transformations are composed by chaining the
     * <code>transform</code> calls.
     * That is, the byte array returned by one call to <code>transform</code> becomes the input
     * (via the <code>classfileBuffer</code> parameter) to the next call.
     *
     * <P>
     * Transformations are applied in the following order:
     *  <ul>
     *    <li>Retransformation incapable transformers
     *    </li>
     *    <li>Retransformation incapable native transformers
     *    </li>
     *    <li>Retransformation capable transformers
     *    </li>
     *    <li>Retransformation capable native transformers
     *    </li>
     *  </ul>
     *
     * <P>
     * For retransformations, the retransformation incapable transformers are not
     * called, instead the result of the previous transformation is reused.
     * In all other cases, this method is called.
     * Within each of these groupings, transformers are called in the order registered.
     * Native transformers are provided by the <code>ClassFileLoadHook</code> event
     * in the Java Virtual Machine Tool Interface).
     *
     * <P>
     * The input (via the <code>classfileBuffer</code> parameter) to the first
     * transformer is:
     *  <ul>
     *    <li>for new class definition,
     *        the bytes passed to <code>ClassLoader.defineClass</code>
     *    </li>
     *    <li>for class redefinition,
     *        <code>definitions.getDefinitionClassFile()</code> where
     *        <code>definitions</code> is the parameter to
     *        {@link java.lang.instrument.Instrumentation#redefineClasses
     *         Instrumentation.redefineClasses}
     *    </li>
     *    <li>for class retransformation,
     *         the bytes passed to the new class definition or, if redefined,
     *         the last redefinition, with all transformations made by retransformation
     *         incapable transformers reapplied automatically and unaltered;
     *         for details see
     *         {@link java.lang.instrument.Instrumentation#retransformClasses
     *          Instrumentation.retransformClasses}
     *    </li>
     *  </ul>
     *
     * <P>
     * If the implementing method determines that no transformations are needed,
     * it should return <code>null</code>.
     * Otherwise, it should create a new <code>byte[]</code> array,
     * copy the input <code>classfileBuffer</code> into it,
     * along with all desired transformations, and return the new array.
     * The input <code>classfileBuffer</code> must not be modified.
     *
     * <P>
     * In the retransform and redefine cases,
     * the transformer must support the redefinition semantics:
     * if a class that the transformer changed during initial definition is later
     * retransformed or redefined, the
     * transformer must insure that the second class output class file is a legal
     * redefinition of the first output class file.
     *
     * <P>
     * If the transformer throws an exception (which it doesn't catch),
     * subsequent transformers will still be called and the load, redefine
     * or retransform will still be attempted.
     * Thus, throwing an exception has the same effect as returning <code>null</code>.
     * To prevent unexpected behavior when unchecked exceptions are generated
     * in transformer code, a transformer can catch <code>Throwable</code>.
     * If the transformer believes the <code>classFileBuffer</code> does not
     * represent a validly formatted class file, it should throw
     * an <code>IllegalClassFormatException</code>;
     * while this has the same effect as returning null. it facilitates the
     * logging or debugging of format corruptions.
