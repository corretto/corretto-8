     *      for the convenience of the callee. This name can be
     *      used for the file name of the schema, or the callee can just

     *      absolute system ID. Those system IDs are relativized by the caller and used
     *      for &lt;xs:import> statements.
     *
     *      If the {@link Result} object does not have a system ID, a schema
     *      for the namespace URI is generated but it won't be explicitly
