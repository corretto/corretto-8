/**
 * A {@link java.util.Set} that uses an internal {@link CopyOnWriteArrayList}
 * for all of its operations.  Thus, it shares the same basic properties:
 * <ul>
 *  <li>It is best suited for applications in which set sizes generally
 *       stay small, read-only operations
 *       vastly outnumber mutative operations, and you need
 *       to prevent interference among threads during traversal.
 *  <li>It is thread-safe.
 *  <li>Mutative operations ({@code add}, {@code set}, {@code remove}, etc.)
 *      are expensive since they usually entail copying the entire underlying
 *      array.
 *  <li>Iterators do not support the mutative {@code remove} operation.
 *  <li>Traversal via iterators is fast and cannot encounter
 *      interference from other threads. Iterators rely on
 *      unchanging snapshots of the array at the time the iterators were
 *      constructed.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Sample Usage.</b> The following code sketch uses a
 * copy-on-write set to maintain a set of Handler objects that
 * perform some action upon state updates.
 *
 *  <pre> {@code
 * class Handler { void handle(); ... }
 *
 * class X {
 *   private final CopyOnWriteArraySet<Handler> handlers
 *     = new CopyOnWriteArraySet<Handler>();
 *   public void addHandler(Handler h) { handlers.add(h); }
 *
 *   private long internalState;
 *   private synchronized void changeState() { internalState = ...; }
 *
 *   public void update() {
 *     changeState();
 *     for (Handler handler : handlers)
 *       handler.handle();
 *   }
 * }}</pre>
