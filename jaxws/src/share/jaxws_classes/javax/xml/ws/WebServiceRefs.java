/**
 * The <code>WebServiceRefs</code> annotation allows
 * multiple web service references to be declared at the
 * class level.
 *
 * <p>
 * It can be used to inject both service and proxy
 * instances. These injected references are not thread safe.
 * If the references are accessed by multiple threads,
 * usual synchronization techniques can be used to
 * support multiple threads.
 *
 * <p>
 * There is no way to associate web service features with
 * the injected instances. If an instance needs to be
 * configured with web service features, use @WebServiceRef
 * to inject the resource along with its features.
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Example</b>: The <code>StockQuoteProvider</code>
 * proxy instance, and the <code>StockQuoteService</code> service
 * instance are injected using @WebServiceRefs.
 *
 * <pre><code>
 *    &#64;WebServiceRefs({&#64;WebServiceRef(name="service/stockquoteservice", value=StockQuoteService.class),
 *                     &#64;WebServiceRef(name="service/stockquoteprovider", type=StockQuoteProvider.class, value=StockQuoteService.class})
 *    public class MyClient {
 *        void init() {
 *            Context ic = new InitialContext();
 *            StockQuoteService service = (StockQuoteService) ic.lookup("java:comp/env/service/stockquoteservice");
 *            StockQuoteProvider port = (StockQuoteProvider) ic.lookup("java:comp/env/service/stockquoteprovider");
 *            ...
 *       }
 *       ...
 *    }
