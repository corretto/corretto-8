  // However that caused complications with the block offset table (BOT).
  // In particular if there were two TLABs, one of them partially refined.
  // |----- TLAB_1--------|----TLAB_2-~~~(partially refined part)~~~|
  // The BOT entries of the unrefined part of TLAB_2 point to the start
  // of TLAB_2. If the last object of the TLAB_1 and the first object
  // of TLAB_2 are coalesced, then the cards of the unrefined part
  // would point into middle of the filler object.
  // The current approach is to not coalesce and leave the BOT contents intact.
  // </original comment>
  //
  // We now reset the BOT when we start the object iteration over the
  // region and refine its entries for every object we come across. So
  // the above comment is not really relevant and we should be able
  // to coalesce dead objects if we want to.
