/**
 * Interface for reading an Fast Infoset document using callbacks.
 *
 * <p>FastInfosetReader is the interface that a Fast Infoset parser's
 * SAX2 driver must implement. This interface allows an application to
 * to register Fast Infoset specific event handlers for encoding algorithms.</p>
 *
 * <p>The reception of encoding algorithm events is determined by
 * the registration of:
 * <ul>
 *    <li>A {@link PrimitiveTypeContentHandler}, for the recieving of events,
 *        associated with built-in encoding algorithms, for decoded data that
 *        can be reported as Java primitive types.</li>
 *    <li>A {@link EncodingAlgorithmContentHandler}, for the recieving of events,
 *        associated with built-in and application-defined encoding algorithms, for
 *        decoded data that can be reported as an array of octets or as a Java
 *        Object.</li>
 *    <li>{@link com.sun.xml.internal.org.jvnet.fastinfoset.EncodingAlgorithm} implementations, for
 *        the receiving of events, associated with application defined algorithms.
 *        for decoded data that shall be reported as a Java Object by way of the
 *        registered EncodingAlgorithmContentHandler.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>The reporting of element content events for built-in algorithms
 *    is determimed by the following:
 * <ul>
 *    <li>If a PrimitiveContentHandler is registered then decoded data is reported
 *        as Java primitive types using the corresponding methods on the PrimitiveContentHandler
 *        interface.</li>
 *    <li>If a PrimitiveContentHandler is not registered and a
 *        EncodingAlgorithmContentHandler is registered then decoded data is reported
 *        as Java Objects using {@link EncodingAlgorithmContentHandler#object(String, int, Object)}.
 *        An Object shall correspond to the Java primitive type that
 *        would otherwise be reported using the PrimitiveContentHandler.</li>
 *    <li>If neither is registered then then decoded data is reported as characters.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>The reporting of element content events for application-defined algorithms
 *    is determimed by the following:
 * <ul>
 *    <li>If an EncodingAlgorithmContentHandler is registered and there is no
 *        EncodingAlgorithm registered for an application-defined encoding algorithm
 *        then decoded data for such an algoroithm is reported as an array of octets
 *        using {@link EncodingAlgorithmContentHandler#octets(String, int, byte[], int, int)};
 *        otherwise</li>
 *    <li>If there is an EncodingAlgorithm registered for the application-defined
 *        encoding algorithm then the decoded data is reported as a Java Object,
 *        returned by decoding according to the EncodingAlgorithm, using
 *        {@link EncodingAlgorithmContentHandler#object(String, int, Object)}.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>The reporting of attribute values for encoding algorithms is achieved using
 * {@link EncodingAlgorithmAttributes} that extends {@link org.xml.sax.Attributes}.
 * The registered ContentHandler may cast the attr paramter of the
 * {@link org.xml.sax.ContentHandler#startElement(String, String, String, org.xml.sax.Attributes)}
 * to the EncodingAlgorithmAttributes interface to access to encoding algorithm information.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>The reporting of attribute values for built-in algorithms
 *    is determimed by the following:
 * <ul>
 *    <li>If a PrimitiveContentHandler or EncodingAlgorithmContentHandler is
 *        registered then decoded data is reported as Java Objects corresponding
 *        to the Java primitive types. The Java Objects may be obtained using
 *        {@link EncodingAlgorithmAttributes#getAlgorithmData(int)}.
 *    <li>If neither is registered then then decoded data is reported as characters.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>The reporting of attribute values for application-defined algorithms
 *    is determimed by the following:
 * <ul>
 *    <li>If an EncodingAlgorithmContentHandler is registered and there is no
 *        EncodingAlgorithm registered for an application-defined encoding algorithm
 *        then decoded data for such an algoroithm is reported as Java Object,
 *        that is an instance of <code>byte[]</code>,
 *        using {@link EncodingAlgorithmAttributes#getAlgorithmData(int)};
 *        otherwise</li>
 *    <li>If there is an EncodingAlgorithm registered for the application-defined
 *        encoding algorithm then the decoded data is reported as a Java Object,
 *        returned by decoding according to the EncodingAlgorithm, using
 *        {@link EncodingAlgorithmAttributes#getAlgorithmData(int)}.</li>
 * </ul>
