/**
 * The container for the SOAPHeader and SOAPBody portions of a
 * <code>SOAPPart</code> object. By default, a <code>SOAPMessage</code>
 * object is created with a <code>SOAPPart</code> object that has a
 * <code>SOAPEnvelope</code> object. The <code>SOAPEnvelope</code> object
 * by default has an empty <code>SOAPBody</code> object and an empty
 * <code>SOAPHeader</code> object.  The <code>SOAPBody</code> object is
 * required, and the <code>SOAPHeader</code> object, though
 * optional, is used in the majority of cases. If the
 * <code>SOAPHeader</code> object is not needed, it can be deleted,
 * which is shown later.
 * <P>
 * A client can access the <code>SOAPHeader</code> and <code>SOAPBody</code>
 * objects by calling the methods <code>SOAPEnvelope.getHeader</code> and
 * <code>SOAPEnvelope.getBody</code>. The
 * following  lines of code use these two methods after starting with
 * the <code>SOAPMessage</code>
 * object <i>message</i> to get the <code>SOAPPart</code> object <i>sp</i>,
 * which is then used to get the <code>SOAPEnvelope</code> object <i>se</i>.
 *
 * <PRE>
 *     SOAPPart sp = message.getSOAPPart();
 *     SOAPEnvelope se = sp.getEnvelope();
 *     SOAPHeader sh = se.getHeader();
 *     SOAPBody sb = se.getBody();
 * </PRE>
 * <P>
 * It is possible to change the body or header of a <code>SOAPEnvelope</code>
 * object by retrieving the current one, deleting it, and then adding
 * a new body or header. The <code>javax.xml.soap.Node</code> method
 * <code>deleteNode</code> deletes the XML element (node) on which it is
 * called.  For example, the following line of code deletes the
 * <code>SOAPBody</code> object that is retrieved by the method <code>getBody</code>.
 * <PRE>
 *      se.getBody().detachNode();
 * </PRE>
 * To create a <code>SOAPHeader</code> object to replace the one that was removed,
 * a client uses
 * the method <code>SOAPEnvelope.addHeader</code>, which creates a new header and
 * adds it to the <code>SOAPEnvelope</code> object. Similarly, the method
 * <code>addBody</code> creates a new <code>SOAPBody</code> object and adds
 * it to the <code>SOAPEnvelope</code> object. The following code fragment
 * retrieves the current header, removes it, and adds a new one. Then
 * it retrieves the current body, removes it, and adds a new one.
 *
 * <PRE>
 *     SOAPPart sp = message.getSOAPPart();
 *     SOAPEnvelope se = sp.getEnvelope();
 *     se.getHeader().detachNode();
 *     SOAPHeader sh = se.addHeader();
 *     se.getBody().detachNode();
 *     SOAPBody sb = se.addBody();
 * </PRE>
 * It is an error to add a <code>SOAPBody</code> or <code>SOAPHeader</code>
 * object if one already exists.
 * <P>
 * The <code>SOAPEnvelope</code> interface provides three methods for creating
 * <code>Name</code> objects. One method creates <code>Name</code> objects with
 * a local name, a namespace prefix, and a namesapce URI. The second method creates
 * <code>Name</code> objects with a local name and a namespace prefix, and the third
 * creates <code>Name</code> objects with just a local name.  The following line of
 * code, in which <i>se</i> is a <code>SOAPEnvelope</code> object, creates a new
 * <code>Name</code> object with all three.
 * <PRE>
 *     Name name = se.createName("GetLastTradePrice", "WOMBAT",
 *                                "http://www.wombat.org/trader");
 * </PRE>
