/**
 * {@link XMLStreamWriter} extended to support XOP.
 *
 * <p>
 * Some infoset serializer (such as XOP encoder, FastInfoset) uses a format
 * that can represent binary data more efficiently than base64 encoding.
 * Such infoset serializer may choose to implement this interface, to allow
 * the caller to pass in binary data more efficiently without first converting
 * it to binary data.
 *
 * <p>
 * Callers capable of using this interface can see if the serializer supports
 * it by simply downcasting {@link XMLStreamWriter} to {@link XMLStreamWriterEx}.
 *
 * <h2>TODO</h2>
 * <ol>
 * <li>
 *   Add methods to write other primitive types, such as hex and integers
 *   (and arrays of).
 *   A textual implementation would write characters in accordance
 *   to the canonical lexical definitions specified in W3C XML Schema: datatypes.
 *   A MTOM implementation would write characters except for the case where octets
 *   that would otherwise be base64 encoded when using the textual implementation.
 *   A Fast Infoset implementation would encoded binary data the primitive types in
 *   binary form.
 * <li>
 *   Consider renaming writeBinary to writeBytesAsBase64 to be consistent with
 *   infoset abstraction.
 * <li>
 *   Add the ability to writeStart and writeEnd on attributes so that the same
 *   methods for writing primitive types (and characters, which will require new methods)
 *   can be used for writing attribute values as well as element content.
