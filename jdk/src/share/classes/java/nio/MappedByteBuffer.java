/**
 * A direct byte buffer whose content is a memory-mapped region of a file.
 *
 * <p> Mapped byte buffers are created via the {@link
 * java.nio.channels.FileChannel#map FileChannel.map} method.  This class
 * extends the {@link ByteBuffer} class with operations that are specific to
 * memory-mapped file regions.
 *
 * <p> A mapped byte buffer and the file mapping that it represents remain
 * valid until the buffer itself is garbage-collected.
 *
 * <p> The content of a mapped byte buffer can change at any time, for example
 * if the content of the corresponding region of the mapped file is changed by
 * this program or another.  Whether or not such changes occur, and when they
 * occur, is operating-system dependent and therefore unspecified.
 *
 * <a name="inaccess"></a><p> All or part of a mapped byte buffer may become
 * inaccessible at any time, for example if the mapped file is truncated.  An
 * attempt to access an inaccessible region of a mapped byte buffer will not
 * change the buffer's content and will cause an unspecified exception to be
 * thrown either at the time of the access or at some later time.  It is
 * therefore strongly recommended that appropriate precautions be taken to
 * avoid the manipulation of a mapped file by this program, or by a
 * concurrently running program, except to read or write the file's content.
 *
 * <p> Mapped byte buffers otherwise behave no differently than ordinary direct
 * byte buffers. </p>
