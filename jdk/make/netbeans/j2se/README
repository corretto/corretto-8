Building the entire JavaSE source base

This project exists for building the entire JavaSE source base which is in the
jdk directory.  Rather than using this project for editing Java code, please
use one of the other projects which will narrow the scope of the sources to a
more manageable size.

Given that it can take a rather long time to build all of the JavaSE code, you
might prefer to build this project from the command line using ant.

The results of building this project are all in the directory
<install-dir>/jdk/build/<platform>-<arch>.  The other subprojects, with the
exception of the "world" project, place their results in same build directory.
