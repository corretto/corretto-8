/**
 * The superclass for all builders.  A builder is a class that provides
 * the structure and content of API documentation.  A builder is completely
 * doclet independent which means that any doclet can use builders to
 * construct documentation, as long as it impelements the appropriate
 * writer interfaces.  For example, if a doclet wanted to use
 * {@link ConstantsSummaryBuilder} to build a constant summary, all it has to
 * do is implement the ConstantsSummaryWriter interface and pass it to the
 * builder using a WriterFactory.
 *
 *  <p><b>This is NOT part of any supported API.
 *  If you write code that depends on this, you do so at your own risk.
 *  This code and its internal interfaces are subject to change or
 *  deletion without notice.</b>
