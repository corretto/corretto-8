/**
 * A basic event handler interface for validation errors.
 *
 * <p>
 * If an application needs to implement customized event handling, it must
 * implement this interface and then register it with either the
 * {@link Unmarshaller#setEventHandler(ValidationEventHandler) Unmarshaller},
 * the {@link Validator#setEventHandler(ValidationEventHandler) Validator}, or
 * the {@link Marshaller#setEventHandler(ValidationEventHandler) Marshaller}.
 * The JAXB Provider will then report validation errors and warnings encountered
 * during the unmarshal, marshal, and validate operations to these event
 * handlers.
 *
 * <p>
 * If the <tt>handleEvent</tt> method throws an unchecked runtime exception,
 * the JAXB Provider must treat that as if the method returned false, effectively
 * terminating whatever operation was in progress at the time (unmarshal,
 * validate, or marshal).
 *
 * <p>
 * Modifying the Java content tree within your event handler is undefined
 * by the specification and may result in unexpected behaviour.
 *
 * <p>
 * Failing to return false from the <tt>handleEvent</tt> method after
 * encountering a fatal error is undefined by the specification and may result
 * in unexpected behavior.
