Building the entire Open JDK source code

This project exists solely for building the entire Open JDK source code,
i.e. both the Hotspot VM and the JDK.

Building this project takes considerable time and disk space.  Expect several
hours and over 3GB.  Given that it takes a long time to build all of this
project code, you might prefer to build it from the command line using ant.

Please note: the results of building this project are *not* put in the place
used by other projects.  In this case, the results are place in

    <install-dir>/build/<platform>-<arch>
and
    <install-dir>/build/<platform>-<arch>-fastdebug
