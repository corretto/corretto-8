/**
 * File manager for tools operating on Java&trade; programming language
 * source and class files.  In this context, <em>file</em> means an
 * abstraction of regular files and other sources of data.
 *
 * <p>When constructing new JavaFileObjects, the file manager must
 * determine where to create them.  For example, if a file manager
 * manages regular files on a file system, it would most likely have a
 * current/working directory to use as default location when creating
 * or finding files.  A number of hints can be provided to a file
 * manager as to where to create files.  Any file manager might choose
 * to ignore these hints.
 *
 * <p>Some methods in this interface use class names.  Such class
 * names must be given in the Java Virtual Machine internal form of
 * fully qualified class and interface names.  For convenience '.'
 * and '/' are interchangeable.  The internal form is defined in
 * chapter four of
 * <cite>The Java&trade; Virtual Machine Specification</cite>.

 * <blockquote><p>
 *   <i>Discussion:</i> this means that the names
 *   "java/lang.package-info", "java/lang/package-info",
 *   "java.lang.package-info", are valid and equivalent.  Compare to
 *   binary name as defined in
 *   <cite>The Java&trade; Language Specification</cite>,
 *   section 13.1 "The Form of a Binary".
 * </p></blockquote>
 *
 * <p>The case of names is significant.  All names should be treated
 * as case-sensitive.  For example, some file systems have
 * case-insensitive, case-aware file names.  File objects representing
 * such files should take care to preserve case by using {@link
 * java.io.File#getCanonicalFile} or similar means.  If the system is
 * not case-aware, file objects must use other means to preserve case.
 *
 * <p><em><a name="relative_name">Relative names</a>:</em> some
 * methods in this interface use relative names.  A relative name is a
 * non-null, non-empty sequence of path segments separated by '/'.
 * '.' or '..'  are invalid path segments.  A valid relative name must
 * match the "path-rootless" rule of <a
 * href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt">RFC&nbsp;3986</a>,
 * section&nbsp;3.3.  Informally, this should be true:
 *
 * <!-- URI.create(relativeName).normalize().getPath().equals(relativeName) -->
 * <pre>  URI.{@linkplain java.net.URI#create create}(relativeName).{@linkplain java.net.URI#normalize normalize}().{@linkplain java.net.URI#getPath getPath}().equals(relativeName)</pre>
 *
 * <p>All methods in this interface might throw a SecurityException.
 *
 * <p>An object of this interface is not required to support
 * multi-threaded access, that is, be synchronized.  However, it must
 * support concurrent access to different file objects created by this
 * object.
 *
 * <p><em>Implementation note:</em> a consequence of this requirement
 * is that a trivial implementation of output to a {@linkplain
 * java.util.jar.JarOutputStream} is not a sufficient implementation.
 * That is, rather than creating a JavaFileObject that returns the
 * JarOutputStream directly, the contents must be cached until closed
 * and then written to the JarOutputStream.
 *
 * <p>Unless explicitly allowed, all methods in this interface might
 * throw a NullPointerException if given a {@code null} argument.
