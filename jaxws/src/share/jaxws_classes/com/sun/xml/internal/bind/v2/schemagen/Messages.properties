ANONYMOUS_TYPE_CYCLE= Error occured during schema generation, however the schema could be generated. \
There is a circular dependency on an element in your schema: {0} \
This element \
is not defined as global element and thus references were not generated and \
the type has been inlined where possible. To allow references for the type, add \
XmlRootElement annotation to your type definition class.
