  //
  //  1. Running interpreted
  //     The interpeter dispatch table is changed to force it to
  //     check for a safepoint condition between bytecodes.
  //  2. Running in native code
  //     When returning from the native code, a Java thread must check
  //     the safepoint _state to see if we must block.  If the
  //     VM thread sees a Java thread in native, it does
  //     not wait for this thread to block.  The order of the memory
  //     writes and reads of both the safepoint state and the Java
  //     threads state is critical.  In order to guarantee that the
  //     memory writes are serialized with respect to each other,
  //     the VM thread issues a memory barrier instruction
  //     (on MP systems).  In order to avoid the overhead of issuing
  //     a memory barrier for each Java thread making native calls, each Java
  //     thread performs a write to a single memory page after changing
  //     the thread state.  The VM thread performs a sequence of
  //     mprotect OS calls which forces all previous writes from all
  //     Java threads to be serialized.  This is done in the
  //     os::serialize_thread_states() call.  This has proven to be
  //     much more efficient than executing a membar instruction
  //     on every call to native code.
  //  3. Running compiled Code
  //     Compiled code reads a global (Safepoint Polling) page that
  //     is set to fault if we are trying to get to a safepoint.
  //  4. Blocked
  //     A thread which is blocked will not be allowed to return from the
  //     block condition until the safepoint operation is complete.
  //  5. In VM or Transitioning between states
  //     If a Java thread is currently running in the VM or transitioning
  //     between states, the safepointing code will wait for the thread to
  //     block itself when it attempts transitions to a new state.

      // Spin to avoid context switching.

      // a mutator might otherwise use profitably to reach a safepoint.  Excessive
      // spinning by the VM thread on a saturated system can increase rendezvous latency.
      // Blocking or yielding incur their own penalties in the form of context switching
      // and the resultant loss of $ residency.
      //
      // Further complicating matters is that yield() does not work as naively expected
      // on many platforms -- yield() does not guarantee that any other ready threads
      // will run.   As such we revert yield_all() after some number of iterations.
      // Yield_all() is implemented as a short unconditional sleep on some platforms.
      // Typical operating systems round a "short" sleep period up to 10 msecs, so sleeping
      // can actually increase the time it takes the VM thread to detect that a system-wide
      // stop-the-world safepoint has been reached.  In a pathological scenario such as that
      // described in CR6415670 the VMthread may sleep just before the mutator(s) become safe.
      // In that case the mutators will be stalled waiting for the safepoint to complete and the
      // the VMthread will be sleeping, waiting for the mutators to rendezvous.  The VMthread
      // will eventually wake up and detect that all mutators are safe, at which point
      // we'll again make progress.
      //
      // Beware too that that the VMThread typically runs at elevated priority.
      // Its default priority is higher than the default mutator priority.
      // Obviously, this complicates spinning.
      //
      // Note too that on Windows XP SwitchThreadTo() has quite different behavior than Sleep(0).
      // Sleep(0) will _not yield to lower priority threads, while SwitchThreadTo() will.
      //
      // See the comments in synchronizer.cpp for additional remarks on spinning.
      //
      // In the future we might:
      // 1. Modify the safepoint scheme to avoid potentally unbounded spinning.
      //    This is tricky as the path used by a thread exiting the JVM (say on
      //    on JNI call-out) simply stores into its state field.  The burden
      //    is placed on the VM thread, which must poll (spin).
      // 2. Find something useful to do while spinning.  If the safepoint is GC-related
      //    we might aggressively scan the stacks of threads that are already safe.
      // 3. Use Solaris schedctl to examine the state of the still-running mutators.
      //    If all the mutators are ONPROC there's no reason to sleep or yield.
      // 4. YieldTo() any still-running mutators that are ready but OFFPROC.
      // 5. Check system saturation.  If the system is not fully saturated then
      //    simply spin and avoid sleep/yield.
      // 6. As still-running mutators rendezvous they could unpark the sleeping
      //    VMthread.  This works well for still-running mutators that become
      //    safe.  The VMthread must still poll for mutators that call-out.
      // 7. Drive the policy on time-since-begin instead of iterations.
      // 8. Consider making the spin duration a function of the # of CPUs:
      //    Spin = (((ncpus-1) * M) + K) + F(still_running)
      //    Alternately, instead of counting iterations of the outer loop
      //    we could count the # of threads visited in the inner loop, above.

      //    to drive subsequent spin/SwitchThreadTo()/Sleep(N) decisions.
