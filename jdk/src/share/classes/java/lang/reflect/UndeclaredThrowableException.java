/**
 * Thrown by a method invocation on a proxy instance if its invocation
 * handler's {@link InvocationHandler#invoke invoke} method throws a
 * checked exception (a {@code Throwable} that is not assignable
 * to {@code RuntimeException} or {@code Error}) that
 * is not assignable to any of the exception types declared in the
 * {@code throws} clause of the method that was invoked on the
 * proxy instance and dispatched to the invocation handler.
 *
 * <p>An {@code UndeclaredThrowableException} instance contains
 * the undeclared checked exception that was thrown by the invocation
 * handler, and it can be retrieved with the
 * {@code getUndeclaredThrowable()} method.
 * {@code UndeclaredThrowableException} extends
 * {@code RuntimeException}, so it is an unchecked exception
 * that wraps a checked exception.
 *
 * <p>As of release 1.4, this exception has been retrofitted to
 * conform to the general purpose exception-chaining mechanism.  The
 * "undeclared checked exception that was thrown by the invocation
 * handler" that may be provided at construction time and accessed via
 * the {@link #getUndeclaredThrowable()} method is now known as the
 * <i>cause</i>, and may be accessed via the {@link
 * Throwable#getCause()} method, as well as the aforementioned "legacy
 * method."
