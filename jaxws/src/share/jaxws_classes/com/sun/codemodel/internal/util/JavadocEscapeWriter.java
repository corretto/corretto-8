/**
 * {@link Writer} that escapes characters that are unsafe
 * as Javadoc comments.
 *
 * Such characters include '&lt;' and '&amp;'.
 *
 * <p>
 * Note that this class doesn't escape other Unicode characters
 * that are typically unsafe. For example, &#x611B; (A kanji
 * that means "love") can be considered as unsafe because
 * javac with English Windows cannot accept this character in the
 * source code.
 *
 * <p>
 * If the application needs to escape such characters as well, then
 * they are on their own.
