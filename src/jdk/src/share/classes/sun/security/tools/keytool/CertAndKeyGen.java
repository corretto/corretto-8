/**
 * Generate a pair of keys, and provide access to them.  This class is

 *
 * <P>This provides some simple certificate management functionality.
 * Specifically, it allows you to create self-signed X.509 certificates
 * as well as PKCS 10 based certificate signing requests.
 *
 * <P>Keys for some public key signature algorithms have algorithm
 * parameters, such as DSS/DSA.  Some sites' Certificate Authorities
 * adopt fixed algorithm parameters, which speeds up some operations
 * including key generation and signing.  <em>At this time, this interface
 * does not provide a way to provide such algorithm parameters, e.g.
 * by providing the CA certificate which includes those parameters.</em>
 *
 * <P>Also, note that at this time only signature-capable keys may be
 * acquired through this interface.  Diffie-Hellman keys, used for secure
 * key exchange, may be supported later.
