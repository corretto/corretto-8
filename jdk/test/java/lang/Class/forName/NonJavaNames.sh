# @test
# @bug 4952558
# @summary Verify names that aren't legal Java names are accepted by forName.
# @author Joseph D. Darcy
# @compile -source 1.5 -target 1.5 NonJavaNames.java
# @run shell NonJavaNames.sh

# This test uses hand-generated class files stored in the ./classes
# directory.  After the renaming done below, those class files have
# single character names that are legal class names under class file
# version 49 but *not* legal Java language identifiers; e.g. "3" and
# "+".  First, Z.java is compiled to Z.class using "-target 1.5."
# Next, to create a test class file, the appropriate name structures
# within the class files are updated, as is the "Hello world" string
# the class's main method prints out.  If the definition of the
# semantics of "-target 1.5" changes, the test class files should be
# regenerated.

# Verify directory context variables are set
