/**
 * A visitor of program elements based on their {@linkplain
 * ElementKind kind} with default behavior appropriate for the {@link
 * SourceVersion#RELEASE_8 RELEASE_8} source version.  For {@linkplain
 * Element elements} <tt><i>XYZ</i></tt> that may have more than one
 * kind, the <tt>visit<i>XYZ</i></tt> methods in this class delegate
 * to the <tt>visit<i>XYZKind</i></tt> method corresponding to the
 * first argument's kind.  The <tt>visit<i>XYZKind</i></tt> methods
 * call {@link #defaultAction defaultAction}, passing their arguments
 * to {@code defaultAction}'s corresponding parameters.
 *
 * <p> Methods in this class may be overridden subject to their
 * general contract.  Note that annotating methods in concrete
 * subclasses with {@link java.lang.Override @Override} will help
 * ensure that methods are overridden as intended.
 *
 * <p> <b>WARNING:</b> The {@code ElementVisitor} interface
 * implemented by this class may have methods added to it or the
 * {@code ElementKind} {@code enum} used in this case may have
 * constants added to it in the future to accommodate new, currently
 * unknown, language structures added to future versions of the
 * Java&trade; programming language.  Therefore, methods whose names
 * begin with {@code "visit"} may be added to this class in the
 * future; to avoid incompatibilities, classes which extend this class
 * should not declare any instance methods with names beginning with
 * {@code "visit"}.
 *
 * <p>When such a new visit method is added, the default
 * implementation in this class will be to call the {@link
 * #visitUnknown visitUnknown} method.  A new abstract element kind
 * visitor class will also be introduced to correspond to the new
 * language level; this visitor will have different default behavior
 * for the visit method in question.  When the new visitor is
 * introduced, all or portions of this visitor may be deprecated.
 *
 * <p>Note that adding a default implementation of a new visit method
 * in a visitor class will occur instead of adding a <em>default
 * method</em> directly in the visitor interface since a Java SE 8
 * language feature cannot be used to this version of the API since
 * this version is required to be runnable on Java SE 7
 * implementations.  Future versions of the API that are only required
 * to run on Java SE 8 and later may take advantage of default methods
 * in this situation.
 *
 * @param <R> the return type of this visitor's methods.  Use {@link
 *            Void} for visitors that do not need to return results.
 * @param <P> the type of the additional parameter to this visitor's
 *            methods.  Use {@code Void} for visitors that do not need an
 *            additional parameter.
 *
 * @see ElementKindVisitor6
 * @see ElementKindVisitor7
 * @since 1.8
