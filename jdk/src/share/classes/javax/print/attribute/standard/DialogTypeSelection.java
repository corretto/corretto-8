 * Class DialogTypeSelection is a printing attribute class, an enumeration,
 * that indicates the user dialog type to be used for specifying
 * printing options.
 * If {@code NATIVE} is specified, then where available, a native
 * platform dialog is displayed.
 * If {@code COMMON} is specified, a cross-platform print dialog is displayed.
 *
 * This option to specify a native dialog for use with an IPP attribute
 * set provides a standard way to reflect back of the setting and option
 * changes made by a user to the calling application, and integrates
 * the native dialog into the Java printing APIs.
 * But note that some options and settings in a native dialog may not
 * necessarily map to IPP attributes as they may be non-standard platform,
 * or even printer specific options.
 * <P>
 * <B>IPP Compatibility:</B> This is not an IPP attribute.
