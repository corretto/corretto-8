/**
 * Interface representing an Access Control List (ACL).  An Access
 * Control List is a data structure used to guard access to
 * resources.<p>
 *
 * An ACL can be thought of as a data structure with multiple ACL
 * entries.  Each ACL entry, of interface type AclEntry, contains a
 * set of permissions associated with a particular principal. (A
 * principal represents an entity such as an individual user or a
 * group). Additionally, each ACL entry is specified as being either
 * positive or negative. If positive, the permissions are to be
 * granted to the associated principal. If negative, the permissions
 * are to be denied.<p>
 *
 * The ACL Entries in each ACL observe the following rules:
 *
 * <ul> <li>Each principal can have at most one positive ACL entry and
 * one negative entry; that is, multiple positive or negative ACL
 * entries are not allowed for any principal.  Each entry specifies
 * the set of permissions that are to be granted (if positive) or
 * denied (if negative).
 *
 * <li>If there is no entry for a particular principal, then the
 * principal is considered to have a null (empty) permission set.
 *
 * <li>If there is a positive entry that grants a principal a
 * particular permission, and a negative entry that denies the
 * principal the same permission, the result is as though the
 * permission was never granted or denied.
 *
 * <li>Individual permissions always override permissions of the
 * group(s) to which the individual belongs. That is, individual
 * negative permissions (specific denial of permissions) override the
 * groups' positive permissions. And individual positive permissions
 * override the groups' negative permissions.
 *
 * </ul>
 *
 * The {@code  java.security.acl } package provides the
 * interfaces to the ACL and related data structures (ACL entries,
 * groups, permissions, etc.), and the {@code  sun.security.acl }
 * classes provide a default implementation of the interfaces. For
 * example, {@code  java.security.acl.Acl } provides the
 * interface to an ACL and the {@code  sun.security.acl.AclImpl }
 * class provides the default implementation of the interface.<p>
 *
 * The {@code  java.security.acl.Acl } interface extends the
 * {@code  java.security.acl.Owner } interface. The Owner
 * interface is used to maintain a list of owners for each ACL.  Only
 * owners are allowed to modify an ACL. For example, only an owner can
 * call the ACL's {@code addEntry} method to add a new ACL entry
 * to the ACL.
