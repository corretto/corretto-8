/**
 * Represents a program element such as a package, class, or method.
 * Each element represents a static, language-level construct
 * (and not, for example, a runtime construct of the virtual machine).
 *
 * <p> Elements should be compared using the {@link #equals(Object)}
 * method.  There is no guarantee that any particular element will
 * always be represented by the same object.
 *
 * <p> To implement operations based on the class of an {@code
 * Element} object, either use a {@linkplain ElementVisitor visitor} or
 * use the result of the {@link #getKind} method.  Using {@code
 * instanceof} is <em>not</em> necessarily a reliable idiom for
 * determining the effective class of an object in this modeling
 * hierarchy since an implementation may choose to have a single object
 * implement multiple {@code Element} subinterfaces.
