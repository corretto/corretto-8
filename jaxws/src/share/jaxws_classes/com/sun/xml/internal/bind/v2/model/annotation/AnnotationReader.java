 * This is the lowest abstraction that encapsulates the difference
 * between reading inline annotations and external binding files.
 *
 * <p>
 * Because the former operates on a {@link Field} and {@link Method}
 * while the latter operates on a "property", the methods defined
 * on this interface takes both, and the callee gets to choose which
 * to use.
 *
 * <p>
 * Most of the get method takes {@link Locatable}, which points to
 * the place/context in which the annotation is read. The returned
 * annotation also implements {@link Locatable} (so that it can
 * point to the place where the annotation is placed), and its
 * {@link Locatable#getUpstream()} will return the given
 * {@link Locatable}.
 *
 *
 * <p>
 * Errors found during reading annotations are reported through the error handler.
 * A valid {@link ErrorHandler} must be registered before the {@link AnnotationReader}
 * is used.
