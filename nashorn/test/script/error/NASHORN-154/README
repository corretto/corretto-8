Section 16 of ECMAScript 5.1 spec details a set of "early errors". Early
errors should be reported before running any line of the script containing
such error(s). Examples include syntax error, errors in regexp literals etc.
This directory contains tests to check early errors are reported as early
errors. Each test starts with a print call -- the output from print should 
not be seen in expected output. If seen, early errors are reported late.
