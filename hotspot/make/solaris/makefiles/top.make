# top.make is included in the Makefile in the build directories.
# It DOES NOT include the vm dependency info in order to be faster.
# Its main job is to implement the incremental form of make lists.
# It also:
#   -builds and runs adlc via adlc.make
#   -generates JVMTI source and docs via jvmti.make (JSR-163)
#   -generate sa-jdi.jar (JDI binding to core files)

# It assumes the following flags are set:
# CFLAGS Platform_file, Src_Dirs_I, Src_Dirs_V, SYSDEFS, AOUT, Jvm_Obj_Files

# -- D. Ungar (5/97) from a file by Bill Bush

# Don't override the built-in $(MAKE).
# Instead, use "gmake" (or "gnumake") from the command line.  --Rose
