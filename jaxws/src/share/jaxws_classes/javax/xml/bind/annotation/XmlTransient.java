/**
 * <p>
 * Prevents the mapping of a JavaBean property/type to XML representation.
 * <p>
 * The <tt>@XmlTransient</tt> annotation is useful for resolving name
 * collisions between a JavaBean property name and a field name or
 * preventing the mapping of a field/property. A name collision can
 * occur when the decapitalized JavaBean property name and a field
 * name are the same. If the JavaBean property refers to the field,
 * then the name collision can be resolved by preventing the
 * mapping of either the field or the JavaBean property using the
 * <tt>@XmlTransient</tt> annotation.
 *
 * <p>
 * When placed on a class, it indicates that the class shouldn't be mapped
 * to XML by itself. Properties on such class will be mapped to XML along
 * with its derived classes, as if the class is inlined.
 *
 * <p><b>Usage</b></p>
 * <p> The <tt>@XmlTransient</tt> annotation can be used with the following
 *     program elements:
 * <ul>
 *   <li> a JavaBean property </li>
 *   <li> field </li>
 *   <li> class </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><tt>@XmlTransient</tt>is mutually exclusive with all other
 * JAXB defined annotations. </p>
 *
 * <p>See "Package Specification" in javax.xml.bind.package javadoc for
 * additional common information.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Example:</b> Resolve name collision between JavaBean property and
 *     field name </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 *   // Example: Code fragment
 *   public class USAddress {
 *
 *       // The field name "name" collides with the property name
 *       // obtained by bean decapitalization of getName() below
 *       &#64;XmlTransient public String name;
 *
 *       String getName() {..};
 *       String setName() {..};
 *   }
 *
 *
 *   &lt;!-- Example: XML Schema fragment -->
 *   &lt;xs:complexType name="USAddress">
 *     &lt;xs:sequence>
 *       &lt;xs:element name="name" type="xs:string"/>
 *     &lt;/xs:sequence>
 *   &lt;/xs:complexType>
 * </pre>
