/**
 * Provider class for the Elliptic Curve provider.
 * Supports EC keypair and parameter generation, ECDSA signing and
 * ECDH key agreement.
 *
 * IMPLEMENTATION NOTE:
 * The Java classes in this provider access a native ECC implementation
 * via JNI to a C++ wrapper class which in turn calls C functions.
 * The Java classes are packaged into the signed sunec.jar in the JRE
 * extensions directory and the C++ and C functions are packaged into
 * libsunec.so or sunec.dll in the JRE native libraries directory.
 * If the native library is not present then this provider is registered
 * with support for fewer ECC algorithms (KeyPairGenerator, Signature and
 * KeyAgreement are omitted).
 *
 * @since   1.7
