/**
 * Contains methods for registering/deregistering listeners to be notified of
 * events fired when objects named in a context changes.
 *
 *<h1>Target</h1>
 * The name parameter in the <tt>addNamingListener()</tt> methods is referred
 * to as the <em>target</em>. The target, along with the scope, identify
 * the object(s) that the listener is interested in.
 * It is possible to register interest in a target that does not exist, but
 * there might be limitations in the extent to which this can be
 * supported by the service provider and underlying protocol/service.
 *<p>
 * If a service only supports registration for existing
 * targets, an attempt to register for a nonexistent target
 * results in a <tt>NameNotFoundException</tt> being thrown as early as possible,
 * preferably at the time <tt>addNamingListener()</tt> is called, or if that is
 * not possible, the listener will receive the exception through the
 * <tt>NamingExceptionEvent</tt>.
 *<p>
 * Also, for service providers that only support registration for existing
 * targets, when the target that a listener has registered for is
 * subsequently removed from the namespace, the listener is notified
 * via a <tt>NamingExceptionEvent</tt> (containing a
 *<tt>NameNotFoundException</tt>).
 *<p>
 * An application can use the method <tt>targetMustExist()</tt> to check
 * whether a <tt>EventContext</tt> supports registration
 * of nonexistent targets.
 *
 *<h1>Event Source</h1>
 * The <tt>EventContext</tt> instance on which you invoke the
 * registration methods is the <em>event source</em> of the events that are
 * (potentially) generated.
 * The source is <em>not necessarily</em> the object named by the target.
 * Only when the target is the empty name is the object named by the target
 * the source.
 * In other words, the target,
 * along with the scope parameter, are used to identify
 * the object(s) that the listener is interested in, but the event source
 * is the <tt>EventContext</tt> instance with which the listener
 * has registered.
 *<p>
 * For example, suppose a listener makes the following registration:
 *<blockquote><pre>
 *      NamespaceChangeListener listener = ...;
 *      src.addNamingListener("x", SUBTREE_SCOPE, listener);
 *</pre></blockquote>
 * When an object named "x/y" is subsequently deleted, the corresponding
 * <tt>NamingEvent</tt> (<tt>evt</tt>)  must contain:
 *<blockquote><pre>
 *      evt.getEventContext() == src
 *      evt.getOldBinding().getName().equals("x/y")
 *</pre></blockquote>
 *<p>
 * Furthermore, listener registration/deregistration is with
 * the <tt>EventContext</tt>
 * <em>instance</em>, and not with the corresponding object in the namespace.
 * If the program intends at some point to remove a listener, then it needs to
 * keep a reference to the <tt>EventContext</tt> instance on
 * which it invoked <tt>addNamingListener()</tt> (just as
 * it needs to keep a reference to the listener in order to remove it
 * later). It cannot expect to do a <tt>lookup()</tt> and get another instance of
 * a <tt>EventContext</tt> on which to perform the deregistration.
 *<h1>Lifetime of Registration</h1>
 * A registered listener becomes deregistered when:
 *<ul>
 *<li>It is removed using <tt>removeNamingListener()</tt>.
 *<li>An exception is thrown while collecting information about the events.
 *  That is, when the listener receives a <tt>NamingExceptionEvent</tt>.
 *<li><tt>Context.close()</tt> is invoked on the <tt>EventContext</tt>
 * instance with which it has registered.
 </ul>
 * Until that point, a <tt>EventContext</tt> instance that has outstanding
 * listeners will continue to exist and be maintained by the service provider.
 *
 *<h1>Listener Implementations</h1>
 * The registration/deregistration methods accept an instance of
 * <tt>NamingListener</tt>. There are subinterfaces of <tt>NamingListener</tt>
 * for different of event types of <tt>NamingEvent</tt>.
 * For example, the <tt>ObjectChangeListener</tt>
 * interface is for the <tt>NamingEvent.OBJECT_CHANGED</tt> event type.
 * To register interest in multiple event types, the listener implementation
 * should implement multiple <tt>NamingListener</tt> subinterfaces and use a
 * single invocation of <tt>addNamingListener()</tt>.
 * In addition to reducing the number of method calls and possibly the code size
 * of the listeners, this allows some service providers to optimize the
 * registration.
 *
 *<h1>Threading Issues</h1>
 *
 * Like <tt>Context</tt> instances in general, instances of
 * <tt>EventContext</tt> are not guaranteed to be thread-safe.
 * Care must be taken when multiple threads are accessing the same
 * <tt>EventContext</tt> concurrently.
 * See the
 * <a href=package-summary.html#THREADING>package description</a>
 * for more information on threading issues.
