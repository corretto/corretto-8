This README is to keep a list facts and known workaround for the pkcs11 java tests
perform as a result of bugs or features in NSS or other pkcs11 libraries.

- NSS ECC None/Basic/Extended
The tests detect the NSS library support for Elliptic Curves as to not
report incorrect failures.  PKCS11 reports back CKR_DOMAIN_PARAMS_INVALID
when the curve is not supported.

- Default libsoftokn3.so
By default PKCS11Test.java will look for libsoftokn3.so.  There are a number of
tests, particularly in Secmod, that need libnss3.so.  The method useNSS() in
PKCS11test.java is to change the search and version checking to libnss3.

ECC Basic supports is secp256r1, secp384r1, and secp521r1.

- A bug in NSS 3.12 (Mozilla bug 471665) causes AES key lengths to be
read incorrectly. KeyStore/SecretKeysBasic.java tiggers this bug and
knows to avoid it.

- A number of EC tests fail because of a DER bug in NSS 3.11.  The best guess
is Mozilla bug 480280.  Those tests that abort execution with a PASS result
are:  TestECDH2, TestECDSA, TestECDSA2 and TestECGenSpec.
