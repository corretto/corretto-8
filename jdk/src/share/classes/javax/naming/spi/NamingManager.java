     *<ol>
     * <li>If <code>refInfo</code> is a <code>Reference</code>
     *    or <code>Referenceable</code> containing a factory class name,
     *    use the named factory to create the object.
     *    Return <code>refInfo</code> if the factory cannot be created.
     *    Under JDK 1.1, if the factory class must be loaded from a location
     *    specified in the reference, a <tt>SecurityManager</tt> must have
     *    been installed or the factory creation will fail.
     *    If an exception is encountered while creating the factory,
     *    it is passed up to the caller.
     * <li>If <tt>refInfo</tt> is a <tt>Reference</tt> or
     *    <tt>Referenceable</tt> with no factory class name,
     *    and the address or addresses are <tt>StringRefAddr</tt>s with
     *    address type "URL",
     *    try the URL context factory corresponding to each URL's scheme id
     *    to create the object (see <tt>getURLContext()</tt>).
     *    If that fails, continue to the next step.
     * <li> Use the object factories specified in
     *    the <tt>Context.OBJECT_FACTORIES</tt> property of the environment,
     *    and of the provider resource file associated with
     *    <tt>nameCtx</tt>, in that order.
     *    The value of this property is a colon-separated list of factory
     *    class names that are tried in order, and the first one that succeeds
     *    in creating an object is the one used.
     *    If none of the factories can be loaded,
     *    return <code>refInfo</code>.
     *    If an exception is encountered while creating the object, the
     *    exception is passed up to the caller.
     *</ol>
     *<p>
     * Service providers that implement the <tt>DirContext</tt>
     * interface should use
     * <tt>DirectoryManager.getObjectInstance()</tt>, not this method.
     * Service providers that implement only the <tt>Context</tt>
     * interface should use this method.
     * <p>
     * Note that an object factory (an object that implements the ObjectFactory
     * interface) must be public and must have a public constructor that
     * accepts no arguments.
     * <p>
     * The <code>name</code> and <code>nameCtx</code> parameters may
     * optionally be used to specify the name of the object being created.
     * <code>name</code> is the name of the object, relative to context
     * <code>nameCtx</code>.  This information could be useful to the object
     * factory or to the object implementation.
     *  If there are several possible contexts from which the object
     *  could be named -- as will often be the case -- it is up to
     *  the caller to select one.  A good rule of thumb is to select the
     * "deepest" context available.
     * If <code>nameCtx</code> is null, <code>name</code> is relative
     * to the default initial context.  If no name is being specified, the
     * <code>name</code> parameter should be null.
     *
     * @param refInfo The possibly null object for which to create an object.
     * @param name The name of this object relative to <code>nameCtx</code>.
     *          Specifying a name is optional; if it is
     *          omitted, <code>name</code> should be null.
     * @param nameCtx The context relative to which the <code>name</code>
     *          parameter is specified.  If null, <code>name</code> is
     *          relative to the default initial context.
     * @param environment The possibly null environment to
     *          be used in the creation of the object factory and the object.
     * @return An object created using <code>refInfo</code>; or
     *          <code>refInfo</code> if an object cannot be created using
     *          the algorithm described above.
     * @exception NamingException if a naming exception was encountered
     *  while attempting to get a URL context, or if one of the
     *          factories accessed throws a NamingException.
     * @exception Exception if one of the factories accessed throws an
     *          exception, or if an error was encountered while loading
     *          and instantiating the factory and object classes.
     *          A factory should only throw an exception if it does not want
     *          other factories to be used in an attempt to create an object.
