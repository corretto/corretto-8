/**
 * NASHORN-703
 *
 * Self modifying assignments and ++/-- operators had two issues
 * 1) the base was loaded twice
 * 2) if the base was anything but an IdentNode, AccessNode or IndexNode and in the scope, it would
 *    only be evaluated once, leading to bytecode stack underflow
 *
 * This file is split into two tests as the presence of eval affects the whole script
 *
 * @test
 * @run
