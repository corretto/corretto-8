Classes for receiving gesture events.

Provides a mechanism to receive various gesture events on JComponents. Gesture notifications are relayed up the component hierarchy from the deepest component under the cursor to the top-level container. Events may be consumed by deeper components to prevent them from propagating to higher components.

Gesture listeners are added to components using the GestureUtilities helper class.
