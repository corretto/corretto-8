/*
 * The following methods (down to ServerClassMachine()) answer
 * the question about whether a machine is a "server-class"
 * machine.  A server-class machine is loosely defined as one
 * with 2 or more processors and 2 gigabytes or more physical
 * memory.  The definition of a processor is a physical package,
 * not a hyperthreaded chip masquerading as a multi-processor.
 * The definition of memory is also somewhat fuzzy, since x86
 * machines seem not to report all the memory in their DIMMs, we
 * think because of memory mapping of graphics cards, etc.
 *
 * This code is somewhat more confused with #ifdef's than we'd
 * like because this file is used by both Solaris and Linux
 * platforms, and so needs to be parameterized for SPARC and
 * i586 hardware.  The other Linux platforms (amd64 and ia64)
 * don't even ask this question, because they only come with
 * server JVMs.
