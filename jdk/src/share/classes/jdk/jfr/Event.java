/**
 * Base class for events, to be subclassed in order to define events and their
 * fields.
 * <p>
 * The following example shows how to implement an {@code Event} class.
 *
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * import jdk.jfr.Event;
 * import jdk.jfr.Description;
 * import jdk.jfr.Label;
 *
 * public class Example {
 *
 *   &#064;Label("Hello World")
 *   &#064;Description("Helps programmer getting started")
 *   static class HelloWorld extends Event {
 *       &#064;Label("Message")
 *       String message;
 *   }
 *
 *   public static void main(String... args) {
 *       HelloWorld event = new HelloWorld();
 *       event.message = "hello, world!";
 *       event.commit();
 *   }
 * }
 * </code>
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * After an event is allocated and its field members are populated, it can be
 * written to the Flight Recorder system by using the {@code #commit()} method.
 * <p>
 * By default, an event is enabled. To disable an event annotate the
 * {@link Event} class with {@code @Enabled(false)}.
 * <p>
 * Supported field types are the Java primitives: {@code boolean}, {@code char},
 * {@code byte}, {@code short}, {@code int}, {@code long}, {@code float}, and
 * {@code double}. Supported reference types are: {@code String}, {@code Thread}
 * and {@code Class}. Arrays, enums, and other reference types are silently
 * ignored and not included. Fields that are of the supported types can be
 * excluded by using the transient modifier. Static fields, even of the
 * supported types, are not included.
 * <p>
 * Tools can visualize data in a meaningful way when annotations are used (for
 * example, {@code Label}, {@code Description}, and {@code Timespan}).
 * Annotations applied to an {@link Event} class or its fields are included if
 * they are present (indirectly, directly, or associated), have the
 * {@code MetadataDefinition} annotation, and they do not contain enums, arrays,
 * or classes.
 * <p>
 * Gathering data to store in an event can be expensive. The
 * {@link Event#shouldCommit()} method can be used to verify whether an event
 * instance would actually be written to the system when the
 * {@code Event#commit()commit} method is invoked. If
 * {@link Event#shouldCommit()} returns false, then those operations can be
 * avoided.
 *
