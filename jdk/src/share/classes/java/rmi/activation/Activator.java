/**
 * The <code>Activator</code> facilitates remote object activation. A
 * "faulting" remote reference calls the activator's
 * <code>activate</code> method to obtain a "live" reference to a
 * "activatable" remote object. Upon receiving a request for activation,
 * the activator looks up the activation descriptor for the activation
 * identifier, <code>id</code>, determines the group in which the
 * object should be activated initiates object re-creation via the
 * group's <code>ActivationInstantiator</code> (via a call to the
 * <code>newInstance</code> method). The activator initiates the
 * execution of activation groups as necessary. For example, if an
 * activation group for a specific group identifier is not already
 * executing, the activator initiates the execution of a VM for the
 * group. <p>
 *
 * The <code>Activator</code> works closely with
 * <code>ActivationSystem</code>, which provides a means for registering
 * groups and objects within those groups, and <code>ActivationMonitor</code>,
 * which recives information about active and inactive objects and inactive
 * groups. <p>
 *
 * The activator is responsible for monitoring and detecting when
 * activation groups fail so that it can remove stale remote references
 * to groups and active object's within those groups.<p>

     * prevent the object from being garbage collected under the
