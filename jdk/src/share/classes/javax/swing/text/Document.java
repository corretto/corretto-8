/**
 * <p>
 * The <code>Document</code> is a container for text that serves
 * as the model for swing text components.  The goal for this
 * interface is to scale from very simple needs (a plain text textfield)
 * to complex needs (an HTML or XML document, for example).
 *
 * <p><b><font size=+1>Content</font></b>
 * <p>
 * At the simplest level, text can be
 * modeled as a linear sequence of characters. To support
 * internationalization, the Swing text model uses
 * <a href="http://www.unicode.org/">unicode</a> characters.
 * The sequence of characters displayed in a text component is
 * generally referred to as the component's <em>content</em>.
 * <p>
 * To refer to locations within the sequence, the coordinates
 * used are the location between two characters.  As the diagram
 * below shows, a location in a text document can be referred to
 * as a position, or an offset. This position is zero-based.
 * <p style="text-align:center"><img src="doc-files/Document-coord.gif"
 * alt="The following text describes this graphic.">
 * <p>
 * In the example, if the content of a document is the
 * sequence "The quick brown fox," as shown in the preceding diagram,
 * the location just before the word "The" is 0, and the location after
 * the word "The" and before the whitespace that follows it is 3.
 * The entire sequence of characters in the sequence "The" is called a
 * <em>range</em>.
 * <p>The following methods give access to the character data
 * that makes up the content.
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #getLength()}
 * <li>{@link #getText(int, int)}
 * <li>{@link #getText(int, int, javax.swing.text.Segment)}
 * </ul>
 * <p><b><font size=+1>Structure</font></b>
 * <p>
 * Text is rarely represented simply as featureless content. Rather,
 * text typically has some sort of structure associated with it.
 * Exactly what structure is modeled is up to a particular Document
 * implementation.  It might be as simple as no structure (i.e. a
 * simple text field), or it might be something like diagram below.
 * <p style="text-align:center"><img src="doc-files/Document-structure.gif"
 * alt="Diagram shows Book->Chapter->Paragraph">
 * <p>
 * The unit of structure (i.e. a node of the tree) is referred to
 * by the <a href="Element.html">Element</a> interface.  Each Element
 * can be tagged with a set of attributes.  These attributes
 * (name/value pairs) are defined by the
 * <a href="AttributeSet.html">AttributeSet</a> interface.
 * <p>The following methods give access to the document structure.
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #getDefaultRootElement()}
 * <li>{@link #getRootElements()}
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b><font size=+1>Mutations</font></b>
 * <p>
 * All documents need to be able to add and remove simple text.
 * Typically, text is inserted and removed via gestures from
 * a keyboard or a mouse.  What effect the insertion or removal
 * has upon the document structure is entirely up to the
 * implementation of the document.
 * <p>The following methods are related to mutation of the
 * document content:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #insertString(int, java.lang.String, javax.swing.text.AttributeSet)}
 * <li>{@link #remove(int, int)}
 * <li>{@link #createPosition(int)}
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b><font size=+1>Notification</font></b>
 * <p>
 * Mutations to the <code>Document</code> must be communicated to
 * interested observers.  The notification of change follows the event model
 * guidelines that are specified for JavaBeans.  In the JavaBeans
 * event model, once an event notification is dispatched, all listeners
 * must be notified before any further mutations occur to the source
 * of the event.  Further, order of delivery is not guaranteed.
 * <p>
 * Notification is provided as two separate events,
 * <a href="../event/DocumentEvent.html">DocumentEvent</a>, and
 * <a href="../event/UndoableEditEvent.html">UndoableEditEvent</a>.
 * If a mutation is made to a <code>Document</code> through its api,
 * a <code>DocumentEvent</code> will be sent to all of the registered
 * <code>DocumentListeners</code>.  If the <code>Document</code>
 * implementation supports undo/redo capabilities, an
 * <code>UndoableEditEvent</code> will be sent
 * to all of the registered <code>UndoableEditListener</code>s.
 * If an undoable edit is undone, a <code>DocumentEvent</code> should be
 * fired from the Document to indicate it has changed again.
 * In this case however, there should be no <code>UndoableEditEvent</code>
 * generated since that edit is actually the source of the change
 * rather than a mutation to the <code>Document</code> made through its
 * api.
 * <p style="text-align:center"><img src="doc-files/Document-notification.gif"
 * alt="The preceding text describes this graphic.">
 * <p>
 * Referring to the above diagram, suppose that the component shown
 * on the left mutates the document object represented by the blue
 * rectangle. The document responds by dispatching a DocumentEvent to
 * both component views and sends an UndoableEditEvent to the listening
 * logic, which maintains a history buffer.
 * <p>
 * Now suppose that the component shown on the right mutates the same
 * document.  Again, the document dispatches a DocumentEvent to both
 * component views and sends an UndoableEditEvent to the listening logic
 * that is maintaining the history buffer.
 * <p>
 * If the history buffer is then rolled back (i.e. the last UndoableEdit
 * undone), a DocumentEvent is sent to both views, causing both of them to
 * reflect the undone mutation to the document (that is, the
 * removal of the right component's mutation). If the history buffer again
 * rolls back another change, another DocumentEvent is sent to both views,
 * causing them to reflect the undone mutation to the document -- that is,
 * the removal of the left component's mutation.
 * <p>
 * The methods related to observing mutations to the document are:
 * <ul>
 * <li><a href="#addDocumentListener(javax.swing.event.DocumentListener)">addDocumentListener(DocumentListener)</a>
 * <li><a href="#removeDocumentListener(javax.swing.event.DocumentListener)">removeDocumentListener(DocumentListener)</a>
 * <li><a href="#addUndoableEditListener(javax.swing.event.UndoableEditListener)">addUndoableEditListener(UndoableEditListener)</a>
 * <li><a href="#removeUndoableEditListener(javax.swing.event.UndoableEditListener)">removeUndoableEditListener(UndoableEditListener)</a>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b><font size=+1>Properties</font></b>
 * <p>
 * Document implementations will generally have some set of properties
 * associated with them at runtime.  Two well known properties are the
 * <a href="#StreamDescriptionProperty">StreamDescriptionProperty</a>,
 * which can be used to describe where the <code>Document</code> came from,
 * and the <a href="#TitleProperty">TitleProperty</a>, which can be used to
 * name the <code>Document</code>.  The methods related to the properties are:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #getProperty(java.lang.Object)}
 * <li>{@link #putProperty(java.lang.Object, java.lang.Object)}
 * </ul>
 *

 * <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jfc/tsc">The Swing Connection</a>
 * and most particularly the article,
