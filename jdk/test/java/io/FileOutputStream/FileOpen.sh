# @summary Test to ensure that opening of hidden Vs non-hidden,
# read/write Vs read-only files for writing works as expected.


# We use a TMP directory on a local disk because this test
# requires that the file to be tested be present on the local disk,
# not on a samba mounted drive or on a drive that is mapped.
# The cmd 'attrib' works only on the local files.
