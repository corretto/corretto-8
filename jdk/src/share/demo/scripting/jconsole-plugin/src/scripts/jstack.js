 * from a timer thread (calling it periodically would slow down the target

 * console prompt. To call jstack in a timer thread, you can use
 *
 *     var t = setInterval(function () { jstack(print); }, 5000);
 *
 * The above call prints threads in sorted order for every 5 seconds.
 * The print output goes to OS console window from which jconsole was 
 * started. The timer can be cancelled later by clearTimeout() function
 * as shown below:
 * 
 *     clearInterval(t);
