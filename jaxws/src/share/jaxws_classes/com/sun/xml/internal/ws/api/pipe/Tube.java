/**
 * Abstraction of the intermediate layers in the processing chain
 * and transport.
 *
 * <h2>What is a {@link Tube}?</h2>
 * <p>
 * {@link Tube} is a basic processing unit that represents SOAP-level
 * protocol handling code. Mutliple tubes are often put together in
 * a line (it needs not one dimensional &mdash; more later), and act on
 * {@link Packet}s in a sequential fashion.
 *
 * <p>
 * {@link Tube}s run asynchronously. That is, there is no guarantee that
 * {@link #processRequest(Packet)} and {@link #processResponse(Packet)} runs
 * in the same thread, nor is there any guarantee that this tube and next
 * tube runs in the same thread. Furthermore, one thread may be used to
 * run multiple pipeline in turn (just like a real CPU runs multiple
 * threads in turn.)
 *
 *
 * <h2>Tube examples</h2>
 * <p>
 * Transport is a kind of tube. It sends the {@link Packet}
 * through, say, HTTP connection, and receives the data back into another {@link Packet}.
 *
 * <p>
 * More often, a tube works like a filter. It acts on a packet,
 * and then it tells the JAX-WS that the packet should be passed into another
 * tube. It can do the same on the way back.
 *
 * <p>
 * For example, XWSS will be a {@link Tube}. It will act on a request
 * {@link Packet}, then perhaps wrap it into
 * another {@link Packet} to encrypt the body and add a header, then
 * the processing will go on to the next tube.
 *
 * <p>
 * Yet another kind of filter tube is those that wraps {@link LogicalHandler}
 * and {@link SOAPHandler}. These tubes are heavy-weight; they often consume
 * a message in a packet and create a new one, and then pass it to the next tube.
 *
 * <p>
 * There would be a {@link Tube} implementation that invokes {@link Provider}.
 * There would be a {@link Tube} implementation that invokes a service method
 * on the user's code.
 * There would be a {@link Dispatch} implementation that invokes a {@link Tube}.
 *
 * <p>
 * WS-MEX can be implemented as a {@link Tube} that looks for
 * {@link Message#getPayloadNamespaceURI()} and serves the request.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * <h2>Tube Lifecycle</h2>
 * Pipeline is expensive to set up, so once it's created it will be reused.
 * A pipeline is not reentrant; one pipeline is used to process one request/response
 * at at time. The same pipeline instance may serve multiple request/response,
 * if one comes after another and they don't overlap.
 * <p>
 * Where a need arises to process multiple requests concurrently, a pipeline
 * gets cloned through {@link TubeCloner}. Note that this need may happen on
 * both server (because it quite often serves multiple requests concurrently)
 * and client (because it needs to support asynchronous method invocations.)
 * <p>
 * Created pipelines (including cloned ones and the original) may be discarded and GC-ed
 * at any time at the discretion of whoever owns pipelines. Tubes can, however, expect
 * at least one copy (or original) of pipeline to live at any given time while a pipeline
 * owner is interested in the given pipeline configuration (in more concerete terms,
 * for example, as long as a dispatch object lives, it's going to keep at least one
 * copy of a pipeline alive.)
 * <p>
 * Before a pipeline owner dies, it may invoke {@link #preDestroy()} on the last
 * remaining pipeline. It is "may" for pipeline owners that live in the client-side
 * of JAX-WS (such as dispatches and proxies), but it is a "must" for pipeline owners
 * that live in the server-side of JAX-WS.
 * <p>
 * This last invocation gives a chance for some pipes to clean up any state/resource
 * acquired (such as WS-RM's sequence, WS-Trust's SecurityToken), although as stated above,
 * this is not required for clients.
 *
 *
 *
 * <h2>Tube and state</h2>
 * <p>
 * The lifecycle of pipelines is designed to allow a {@link Tube} to store various
 * state in easily accessible fashion.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Per-packet state</h3>
 * <p>
 * Any information that changes from a packet to packet should be
 * stored in {@link Packet} (if such informaton is specific to your problem domain,
 * then most likely {@link Packet#invocationProperties}.)
 * This includes information like transport-specific headers.
 *
 * <h3>Per-thread state</h3>
 * <p>
 * Any expensive-to-create objects that are non-reentrant can be stored
 * either in instance variables of a {@link Tube}, or a static {@link ThreadLocal}.
 *
 * <p>
 * The first approach works, because {@link Tube} is
 * non reentrant. When a tube is copied, new instances should be allocated
 * so that two {@link Tube} instances don't share thread-unsafe resources.
 *
 * Similarly the second approach works, since {@link ThreadLocal} guarantees
 * that each thread gets its own private copy.
 *
 * <p>
 * The former is faster to access, and you need not worry about clean up.
 * On the other hand, because there can be many more concurrent requests
 * than # of threads, you may end up holding onto more resources than necessary.
 *
 * <p>
 * This includes state like canonicalizers, JAXB unmarshallers,
 * {@link SimpleDateFormat}, etc.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Per-proxy/per-endpoint state</h3>
 * <p>
 * Information that is tied to a particular proxy/dispatch can be stored
 * in a separate object that is referenced from a tube. When
 * a new tube is copied, you can simply hand out a reference to the newly
 * created one, so that all copied tubes refer to the same instance.
 * See the following code as an example:
 *
 * <pre>
 * class TubeImpl {
 *   // this object stores per-proxy state
 *   class DataStore {
 *     int counter;
 *   }
 *
 *   private DataStore ds;
 *
 *   // create a fresh new pipe
 *   public TubeImpl(...) {
 *     ....
 *     ds = new DataStore();
 *   }
 *
 *   // copy constructor
 *   private TubeImpl(TubeImpl that, PipeCloner cloner) {
 *     cloner.add(that,this);
 *     ...
 *     this.ds = that.ds;
 *   }
 *
 *   public TubeImpl copy(PipeCloner pc) {
 *     return new TubeImpl(this,pc);
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Note that access to such resource may need to be synchronized,
 * since multiple copies of pipelines may execute concurrently.
 *
 *
 *
 * <h3>VM-wide state</h3>
 * <p>
 * <tt>static</tt> is always there for you to use.
