/**
 * A <code>Synthesizer</code> generates sound.  This usually happens when one of
 * the <code>Synthesizer</code>'s {@link MidiChannel} objects receives a
 * {@link MidiChannel#noteOn(int, int) noteOn} message, either
 * directly or via the <code>Synthesizer</code> object.
 * Many <code>Synthesizer</code>s support <code>Receivers</code>, through which
 * MIDI events can be delivered to the <code>Synthesizer</code>.
 * In such cases, the <code>Synthesizer</code> typically responds by sending
 * a corresponding message to the appropriate <code>MidiChannel</code>, or by
 * processing the event itself if the event isn't one of the MIDI channel
 * messages.
 * <p>
 * The <code>Synthesizer</code> interface includes methods for loading and
 * unloading instruments from soundbanks.  An instrument is a specification for synthesizing a
 * certain type of sound, whether that sound emulates a traditional instrument or is
 * some kind of sound effect or other imaginary sound. A soundbank is a collection of instruments, organized
 * by bank and program number (via the instrument's <code>Patch</code> object).
 * Different <code>Synthesizer</code> classes might implement different sound-synthesis
 * techniques, meaning that some instruments and not others might be compatible with a
 * given synthesizer.
 * Also, synthesizers may have a limited amount of memory for instruments, meaning
 * that not every soundbank and instrument can be used by every synthesizer, even if
 * the synthesis technique is compatible.
 * To see whether the instruments from
 * a certain soundbank can be played by a given synthesizer, invoke the
 * {@link #isSoundbankSupported(Soundbank) isSoundbankSupported} method of
 * <code>Synthesizer</code>.
 * <p>
 * "Loading" an instrument means that that instrument becomes available for
 * synthesizing notes.  The instrument is loaded into the bank and
 * program location specified by its <code>Patch</code> object.  Loading does
 * not necessarily mean that subsequently played notes will immediately have
 * the sound of this newly loaded instrument.  For the instrument to play notes,
 * one of the synthesizer's <code>MidiChannel</code> objects must receive (or have received)
 * a program-change message that causes that particular instrument's
 * bank and program number to be selected.
