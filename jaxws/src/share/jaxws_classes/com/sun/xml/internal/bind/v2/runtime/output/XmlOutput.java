/**
 * Well-formed XML writer.
 *
 * <p>
 * Implementations of this interface is used to connect {@link XMLSerializer}
 * to the actual target. This allows {@link XMLSerializer} to be API agnostic.
 *
 *
 * <h2>Notes</h2>
 * <p>
 * {@link JAXBContext} assigns indices to URIs and local names
 * that are statically known by using {@link NameList}.
 * {@link XmlOutput} implementation can use these indices to improve
 * the performance. For example, those namespace URI indices can be
 * turned into prefixes quickly.
 *
 * <p>
 * {@link XmlOutput} still allows arbitrary namepsace URIs / local names
 * to be written.
 *
 * <p>
 * The {@link NamespaceContextImpl} object, which is shared between {@link XmlOutput} and
 * {@link XMLSerializer}, keeps track of the in-scope namespace bindings. By the time
 * the {@link #beginStartTag} method is called, all the namespace bindings for the new
 * element is already declared. Similarly, after the {@link #endTag} method is called,
 * in-scope bindings will be removed. This book keeping is all done outside {@link XmlOutput}.
 *
 * <p>
 * {@link XmlOutput} and {@link XMLSerializer} uses indices to
 * reference prefixes/URIs to be written. {@link NamespaceContextImpl} can
 * convert prefix indices to URIs and the string representations of prefixes.
 * Binding from indices to URIs and prefixes do not change while indices
 * are "in scope", so {@link XmlOutput} is again expected to take advantage of
 * this to improve the perofmrnace.
 *
 * <p>
 * prefix index 0 is reserved for "xml", and this binding is assumed to be always there.
 * {@link NamespaceContextImpl} can handle this index correctly, but this binding will never
 * be reported to {@link XmlOutput} through {@link #beginStartTag}.
 *
 * <p>
 * One pecurilar behavior of a {@link NamespaceContextImpl} object is that it tries
 * to define redundant xmlns="" on the root element. Implementations of {@link XmlOutput}
 * is encouraged to check for this and avoid generating redundant namespace declarations.
 *
 *
 *
 * <h2>Call Sequence</h2>
 * <p>
 * {@link XMLSerializer} calls the writer methods in the following order:
 *
 * <pre>
 * CALLSEQUENCE  :=  {@link #startDocument startDocument} ELEMENT {@link #endDocument endDocument}
 *               |   ELEMENT   // for fragment
 *
 * ELEMENT       :=  {@link #beginStartTag beginStartTag} {@link #attribute attribute}* {@link #endStartTag endStartTag} CONTENTS {@link #endTag endTag}
 *
 * CONTENTS      :=  (ELEMENT | {@link #text text})*
 * </pre>
 *
 * TODO: for FI, consider making attribute values from Strings to CharSequences.
