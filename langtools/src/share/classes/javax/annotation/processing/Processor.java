/**
 * The interface for an annotation processor.
 *
 * <p>Annotation processing happens in a sequence of {@linkplain
 * javax.annotation.processing.RoundEnvironment rounds}.  On each
 * round, a processor may be asked to {@linkplain #process process} a
 * subset of the annotations found on the source and class files
 * produced by a prior round.  The inputs to the first round of
 * processing are the initial inputs to a run of the tool; these
 * initial inputs can be regarded as the output of a virtual zeroth
 * round of processing.  If a processor was asked to process on a
 * given round, it will be asked to process on subsequent rounds,
 * including the last round, even if there are no annotations for it
 * to process.  The tool infrastructure may also ask a processor to
 * process files generated implicitly by the tool's operation.
 *
 * <p> Each implementation of a {@code Processor} must provide a
 * public no-argument constructor to be used by tools to instantiate
 * the processor.  The tool infrastructure will interact with classes
 * implementing this interface as follows:
 *
 * <ol>
 *
 * <li>If an existing {@code Processor} object is not being used, to
 * create an instance of a processor the tool calls the no-arg
 * constructor of the processor class.
 *
 * <li>Next, the tool calls the {@link #init init} method with
 * an appropriate {@code ProcessingEnvironment}.
 *
 * <li>Afterwards, the tool calls {@link #getSupportedAnnotationTypes
 * getSupportedAnnotationTypes}, {@link #getSupportedOptions
 * getSupportedOptions}, and {@link #getSupportedSourceVersion
 * getSupportedSourceVersion}.  These methods are only called once per
 * run, not on each round.
 *
 * <li>As appropriate, the tool calls the {@link #process process}
 * method on the {@code Processor} object; a new {@code Processor}
 * object is <em>not</em> created for each round.
 *
 * </ol>
 *
 * If a processor object is created and used without the above
 * protocol being followed, then the processor's behavior is not
 * defined by this interface specification.
 *
 * <p> The tool uses a <i>discovery process</i> to find annotation
 * processors and decide whether or not they should be run.  By
 * configuring the tool, the set of potential processors can be
 * controlled.  For example, for a {@link javax.tools.JavaCompiler
 * JavaCompiler} the list of candidate processors to run can be
 * {@linkplain javax.tools.JavaCompiler.CompilationTask#setProcessors
 * set directly} or controlled by a {@linkplain
 * javax.tools.StandardLocation#ANNOTATION_PROCESSOR_PATH search path}
 * used for a {@linkplain java.util.ServiceLoader service-style}
 * lookup.  Other tool implementations may have different
 * configuration mechanisms, such as command line options; for
 * details, refer to the particular tool's documentation.  Which
 * processors the tool asks to {@linkplain #process run} is a function
 * of the types of the annotations <em>{@linkplain AnnotatedConstruct present}</em>
 * on the {@linkplain
 * RoundEnvironment#getRootElements root elements}, what {@linkplain
 * #getSupportedAnnotationTypes annotation types a processor
 * supports}, and whether or not a processor {@linkplain #process
 * claims the annotation types it processes}.  A processor will be asked to
 * process a subset of the annotation types it supports, possibly an
 * empty set.
 *
 * For a given round, the tool computes the set of annotation types
 * that are present on the elements enclosed within the root elements.
 * If there is at least one annotation type present, then as
 * processors claim annotation types, they are removed from the set of
 * unmatched annotation types.  When the set is empty or no more
 * processors are available, the round has run to completion.  If
 * there are no annotation types present, annotation processing still
 * occurs but only <i>universal processors</i> which support
 * processing all annotation types, {@code "*"}, can claim the (empty)
 * set of annotation types.
 *
 * <p>An annotation type is considered present if there is at least
 * one annotation of that type present on an element enclosed within
 * the root elements of a round. For this purpose, a type parameter is
 * considered to be enclosed by its {@linkplain
 * TypeParameterElement#getGenericElement generic
 * element}. Annotations on {@linkplain
 * java.lang.annotation.ElementType#TYPE_USE type uses}, as opposed to
 * annotations on elements, are ignored when computing whether or not
 * an annotation type is present.
 *
 * <p>An annotation is present if it meets the definition of being
 * present given in {@link AnnotatedConstruct}. In brief, an
 * annotation is considered present for the purposes of discovery if
 * it is directly present or present via inheritance. An annotation is
 * <em>not</em> considered present by virtue of being wrapped by a
 * container annotation. Operationally, this is equivalent to an
 * annotation being present on an element if and only if it would be
 * included in the results of {@link
 * Elements#getAllAnnotationMirrors(Element)} called on that element. Since
 * annotations inside container annotations are not considered
 * present, to properly process {@linkplain
 * java.lang.annotation.Repeatable repeatable annotation types},
 * processors are advised to include both the repeatable annotation
 * type and its containing annotation type in the set of {@linkplain
 * #getSupportedAnnotationTypes() supported annotation types} of a
 * processor.
 *
 * <p>Note that if a processor supports {@code "*"} and returns {@code
 * true}, all annotations are claimed.  Therefore, a universal
 * processor being used to, for example, implement additional validity
 * checks should return {@code false} so as to not prevent other such
 * checkers from being able to run.
 *
 * <p>If a processor throws an uncaught exception, the tool may cease
 * other active annotation processors.  If a processor raises an
 * error, the current round will run to completion and the subsequent
 * round will indicate an {@linkplain RoundEnvironment#errorRaised
 * error was raised}.  Since annotation processors are run in a
 * cooperative environment, a processor should throw an uncaught
 * exception only in situations where no error recovery or reporting
 * is feasible.
 *
 * <p>The tool environment is not required to support annotation
 * processors that access environmental resources, either {@linkplain
 * RoundEnvironment per round} or {@linkplain ProcessingEnvironment
 * cross-round}, in a multi-threaded fashion.
 *
 * <p>If the methods that return configuration information about the
 * annotation processor return {@code null}, return other invalid
 * input, or throw an exception, the tool infrastructure must treat
 * this as an error condition.
 *
 * <p>To be robust when running in different tool implementations, an
 * annotation processor should have the following properties:
 *
 * <ol>
 *
 * <li>The result of processing a given input is not a function of the presence or absence
 * of other inputs (orthogonality).
 *
 * <li>Processing the same input produces the same output (consistency).
 *
 * <li>Processing input <i>A</i> followed by processing input <i>B</i>
 * is equivalent to processing <i>B</i> then <i>A</i>
 * (commutativity)
 *
 * <li>Processing an input does not rely on the presence of the output
 * of other annotation processors (independence)
 *
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>The {@link Filer} interface discusses restrictions on how
 * processors can operate on files.
 *
 * <p>Note that implementors of this interface may find it convenient
 * to extend {@link AbstractProcessor} rather than implementing this
 * interface directly.

    * example an {@code int} member whose value should lie between 1
    * and 10 or a string member that should be recognized by a known
    * grammar, such as a regular expression or a URL.
    *
    * <p>Since incomplete programs are being modeled, some of the

    * a single completion with an empty value string and a message
    * describing why there are no completions.
    *
    * <p>Completions are informative and may reflect additional
    * validity checks performed by annotation processors.  For
    * example, consider the simple annotation:
    *
    * <blockquote>
    * <pre>

    * 2<sup><i>n</i></sup> - 1.) Given an {@code AnnotationMirror}
    * for this annotation type, a list of all such primes in the
    * {@code int} range could be returned without examining any other
    * arguments to {@code getCompletions}:
    *
    * <blockquote>
    * <pre>
    * import static javax.annotation.processing.Completions.*;
    * ...
    * return Arrays.asList({@link Completions#of(String) of}(&quot;3&quot;),

    *                      of(&quot;127&quot;),
    *                      of(&quot;8191&quot;),

    * </pre>
    * </blockquote>
    *
    * A more informative set of completions would include the number
    * of each prime:
    *
    * <blockquote>
    * <pre>
    * return Arrays.asList({@link Completions#of(String, String) of}(&quot;3&quot;,          &quot;M2&quot;),
    *                      of(&quot;7&quot;,          &quot;M3&quot;),
    *                      of(&quot;31&quot;,         &quot;M5&quot;),
    *                      of(&quot;127&quot;,        &quot;M7&quot;),

    * example, if the user has typed
    *
    * <blockquote>
    * <code>
    * &#064;MersennePrime(1
    * </code>
    * </blockquote>
    *

    * <blockquote>

    * return Arrays.asList(of(&quot;127&quot;,        &quot;M7&quot;),
    *                      of(&quot;131071&quot;,     &quot;M17&quot;));
    * </pre>
    * </blockquote>
    *
    * Sometimes no valid completion is possible.  For example, there
    * is no in-range Mersenne prime starting with 9:
    *
    * <blockquote>
    * <code>
    * &#064;MersennePrime(9
    * </code>
    * </blockquote>
    *
    * An appropriate response in this case is to either return an
    * empty list of completions,
    *
    * <blockquote>
    * <pre>
    * return Collections.emptyList();
    * </pre>
    * </blockquote>
